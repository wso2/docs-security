### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
The registry advanced search user interface is found to be vulnerable to a potential Reflected XSS attack when a user injects a malicious executable script as user input through carbon management console.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):

* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-registry/pull/327](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-registry/pull/327)
