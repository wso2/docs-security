* WSO2 API Manager Analytics : 2.6.0 
* WSO2 IoT Server : 3.3.1


### OVERVIEW
HTTP request headers get reflected in the response to the client.


### DESCRIPTION
When an HTTP based API request returns an error or when an HTTP OPTIONS call is made, request headers are returning back to the client as response headers, without any filtration from the server.


### IMPACT
By leveraging this vulnerability, a malicious actor could set response header values in a way that might harm an unsuspecting user.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
