### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server : 5.2.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential spoofing vulnerability has been identified in the Passive-STS flow.


### DESCRIPTION
This vulnerability could be exploited by sending an invalid "wtrealm" parameter in the Passive STS request. WSO2 Identity server does not validate that parameter, but according to the WS-Federation specification[1] that should be validated.


### IMPACT
Since Identity Server does not validate the **wtrealm** parameter, a client application can obtain a security token by sending an invalid **wtrealm** value.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):

* [https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-inbound-auth-sts/pull/58](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-inbound-auth-sts/pull/58)

!!! note
    **If you are a WSO2 customer with Support Subscription, please use [WSO2 Update Manager](https://wso2.com/updates/wum)(WUM) updates in order to apply the fix to the affected versions.**
