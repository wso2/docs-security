### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 2.2.0 , 2.5.0 , 2.6.0
* WSO2 IoT Server : 3.3.1


### OVERVIEW
Lack of Server-Side input validation in API Store.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to lack of server-side input validation in the **Forum** feature, API rating could be manipulated.


### IMPACT
A malicious actor could use this vulnerability to influence the ranking of APIs by increasing its rating. This can negatively impact when API rating is used for sorting.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):

* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-apimgt/pull/10471](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-apimgt/pull/10471)

The rating related information is stored in the `REG_RATING` table and `REG_RESOURCE_RATING` table of the registry database. In order to identify if this vulnerability has been used by a malicious actor in your deployment, query for database entries where the **reg_resource** path starts with **/_system/governance/forumtopics/common** and the rating is greater than 5.

You may use the following database query to perform this check:

```sql
SELECT RT.REG_RATING_ID, RA.REG_RATING, P.REG_PATH_VALUE FROM REG_RESOURCE_RATING RT, REG_RESOURCE R, REG_RATING RA, REG_PATH P WHERE (R. REG_VERSION=RT.REG_VERSION OR (R.REG_PATH_ID=RT.REG_PATH_ID AND R.REG_NAME=RT. REG_RESOURCE_NAME)) AND RA.REG_ID = RT.REG_RATING_ID AND RA.REG_RATING > 5 AND R. REG_PATH_ID=P.REG_PATH_ID AND P.REG_PATH_VALUE like '/_system/governance/forumtopics /common%'; 
```

If the aforementioned query does not return any records it is not required to take any corrective actions. If any records were found, extract the **REG_RATING_ID(s)** returned from the above query, and then reset **REG_RATING** to a value within the valid range of 0 to 5. You may use the following query to perform such update:

```sql
UPDATE REG_RATING SET REG_RATING = 5 WHERE REG_ID=;
```

Querying for ratings is described in [1].
