### OVERVIEW
A potential Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the management console.


### DESCRIPTION
This vulnerability can be exploited when adding a user store for the description field in queues by injecting malicious script as the user input through the management console.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attack would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
Upgrade the affected products to the following versions or [higher released version](http://wso2.com/products/carbon/release-matrix/) which is not affected by this vulnerability.  If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
