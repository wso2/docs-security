### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager
* WSO2 IS as Key Manager
* WSO2 Identity Server


### OVERVIEW
Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been identified in the authentication endpoint web application in WSO2 products.


### DESCRIPTION
XSS attack could be performed in the API based-basicauth.jsp, basicauth.jsp and login.jsp pages of the authentication endpoint by sending an HTTP GET request with a harmful request parameter.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.

Please download the relevant patches based on the products you use following the matrix below. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/).
