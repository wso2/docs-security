### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the inline API documentation editor page of the API Publisher.


### DESCRIPTION
A reflected XSS attack could be performed in the inline API documentation editor page of the API Publisher by sending an HTTP GET request with a harmful request parameter for **docName**.


### IMPACT
An attacker can trick a privileged user to click a crafted URL via email, IM or a neutral web site, then the attacker can make the browser to get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
