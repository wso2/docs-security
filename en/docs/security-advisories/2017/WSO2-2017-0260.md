### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is detected in Dashboard Portal.


### DESCRIPTION
This addresses a potential XSS vulnerability identified in Dashboard Portal login-controller when Single Sign On is enabled. It has been identified that two such parameters displayed in the HTML page result were not properly encoded before displaying.


### IMPACT
An attacker can include malicious content in a request to the dashboard portal, and trick a user to click a crafted URL via email, IM or a neutral web site. This reflects the attack back to the user's browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.
