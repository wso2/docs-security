### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
In Carbon Tenant Management UI,  the identified XSS attack can be performed when a user injects a malicious executable script as a user input through carbon management console.

This issue has been fixed in affected component versions with security patch/update given for specific products.


### IMPACT
An attacker aware of the management console origin can include malicious content in a request and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral web site. This reflects the attack back to the user’s browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.
