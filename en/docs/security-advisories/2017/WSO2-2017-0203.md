### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Message Broker 3.1.0


### OVERVIEW
The Message Broker event UI of above WSO2 products is vulnerable to a potential reflected XSS attack.


### DESCRIPTION
A potential XSS vulnerability has been discovered in the andes event UI component in Message Broker. An attacker can possibly attack the management console via this component, using a reflected XSS and inject malicious scripts as a part of the URL which will be reflected in that component’s pages.


### IMPACT
An attacker aware of the management console origin can include malicious content in a request to event UI's add_subtopic page and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral web site. This reflects the attack back to the user's browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
