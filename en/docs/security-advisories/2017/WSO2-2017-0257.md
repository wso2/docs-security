### OVERVIEW
A potential Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is detected in a JavaScript utility used for displaying messages in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
A stored XSS attack could be performed in the Management Console by filling a form field with a harmful script and later executing it when trying to perform a UI action based on that data.

This has been possible due to the utility JavaScript function used to display the pop messages related to that UI action has not been properly encoded to prevent XSS.


### IMPACT
By performing a Stored XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attack would not be possible.
