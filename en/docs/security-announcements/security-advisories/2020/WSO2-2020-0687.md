### OVERVIEW
Session Hijacking vulnerability in the SOAP service **Try it** tool.


### DESCRIPTION
Carbon Management Console's session cookie of a legitimate user could get delivered to an attacker-controlled endpoint by tricking that user to submit a URL of SOAP service **Try it** tool with a malicious payload.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the Session Hijacking vulnerability, it is possible to steal session cookies if the attacker-controlled environments are reachable from the Carbon Management Console nodes. Once the attacker receives the session cookies, they can use those to access the Carbon Management Console if they have network level access to it.

The risk from this Session Hijacking vulnerability would be reduced if the unwarranted inbound and outbound network access are blocked from Carbon Management Console nodes.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, community users may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
