### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Enterprise Integrator : 6.6.0 or earlier


### OVERVIEW
Stored Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS) vulnerability in BPMN explorer.


### DESCRIPTION
In BPMN explorer when comments are added to tasks, an attacker can replace the request with an XSS payload. Then XSS payload gets stored and executed every time the user loads the task.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):

* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-business-process/pull/621](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-business-process/pull/621)

Further, BPMN explorer is a sample web application which is not recommended in production environment. If required, you can develop your own web apps to replace the BPMN Explorer[^1].
