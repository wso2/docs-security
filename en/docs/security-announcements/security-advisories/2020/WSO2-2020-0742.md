* WSO2 API Microgateway : 2.2.0


### OVERVIEW
Potential unauthenticated XML External Entity injection (XXE) and XML Entity Expansion vulnerabilities have been identified in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
It was found that the Management Console is vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection and XML Entity Expansion attacks. A remote attacker could send unauthenticated requests with malicious payloads to the affected server.


### IMPACT
An XML External Entity injection (XXE) often allows an attacker to view files on the server file system, and to interact with any backend or external systems that the application itself can access and allows the attacker to transmit sensitive data from the compromised server to a system that the attacker controls. An XML Entity Expansion attack might result in a denial-of-service condition, causing the entire application to stop functioning. It is possible to exploit both of the above vulnerabilities without authenticating to the Management Console.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):

* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-governance/pull/341](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-governance/pull/341) 
* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-governance/pull/340](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-governance/pull/340)
* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-governance/pull/339](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-governance/pull/339)
