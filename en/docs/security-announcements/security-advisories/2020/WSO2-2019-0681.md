### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Enterprise Integrator : 6.1.1 or earlier


### OVERVIEW
A Broken Authentication vulnerability has been identified in tenant deactivation operation.


### DESCRIPTION
Tenant deactivation operation performed by a super admin user, through the management console, does not reflect until the next server restart. This vulnerability is applicable only in multi-tenant environments.


### IMPACT
Since deactivation of tenant requires a server restart, any user of a deactivated tenant can login to the management console and perform operations until the sever restart.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

As a temporary risk mitigation, you may restart the affected product after performing a tenant deactivation operation.
