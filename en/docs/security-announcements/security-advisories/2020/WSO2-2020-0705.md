* WSO2 IS as Key Manager : 5.9.0 or earlier
* WSO2 Identity Server : 5.9.0 or earlier


### OVERVIEW
A potential authorization bypass vulnerability has been identified in the basic authentication flow of the REST APIs.


### DESCRIPTION
When there are two users with the same username in both PRIMARY and secondary userstore and when the user uses basic authentication without the userstore domain in the username, authorization check in REST APIs happens without the userstore domain.


### IMPACT
The user in the secondary userstore can perform actions with the privileges of the user in the primary userstore.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
