### OVERVIEW
A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in registry resource info UI.


### DESCRIPTION
This vulnerability can be exploitable in the registry resource info UI when a user adds a comment with a malicious script.

### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
