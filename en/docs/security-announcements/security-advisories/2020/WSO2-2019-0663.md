### OVERVIEW
A potential User Enumeration vulnerability has been found in WSO2 products.


### DESCRIPTION
This vulnerbility is reproducable only If the showAuthFailureReason parameter is set to true for the BasicAuthenticator. When the basic authenticator is used, if wrong user credentials are entered, an error code is sent in the response params which indicates that the user does not exist in the system.


### IMPACT
By leveraging a User Enumeration attack, an attacker can identify valid users of the system and exploit further attacks.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
