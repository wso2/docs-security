### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 2.6.0 or earlier

### OVERVIEW
A broken authorization vulnerability via OAuth token cache.


### DESCRIPTION
When there is a similar username in the primary user store and in a federated IDP, the same key for OAuth cache is generated irrespective of whether the authorized user is a federated user or not, if the Client ID and the requested scopes are the same.


### IMPACT
As user identification is not unique when generating a cache key, primary user store user's cached data will be used for federated users or vice versa. Therefore, a malicious user in a federated IDP will be able to gain access to the secured resources of a user from primary user store.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
