### OVERVIEW
It has been identified that Management Console is vulnerable to an XXE attack when adding and updating a Lifecycle.

### DESCRIPTION
In the event-receiver component, a secure processing feature has not been enabled for XML parsers to prevent XXE attacks.

### IMPACT
The XXE attacks can affect any trusted system respective to the machine where the parser is located. This attack may result in disclosing local files, denial of service, server-side request forgery, port scanning and other system impacts on affected systems.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
