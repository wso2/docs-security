### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Enterprise Integrator : 6.5.0 or earlier


### OVERVIEW
Several potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been identified in proxy services creation page of the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Several reflected XSS attacks could be performed in the proxy services creation page of the Management Console by sending an HTTP GET request with a harmful request parameter.


### IMPACT
An attacker can trick a privileged user to click a crafted URL via email, IM or a neutral website, then the attacker can make the browser to get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
