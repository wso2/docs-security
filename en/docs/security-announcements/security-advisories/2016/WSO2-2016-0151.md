### OVERVIEW
An XSS vulnerability was discovered in the error responses for the API requests received by API Manager 2.0.0 for invalid resource paths.


### DESCRIPTION
The requests made to an API with resource paths containing invalid contexts/resource names/methods that are made of malicious scripts could result in reflected XSS attacks via the error responses returned by the API Manager.


### IMPACT
If the error response containing the malicious script which was sent along with the request gets displayed on the client side, that script could get executed in the user’s browser resulting in a reflected XSS attack.


### SOLUTION
Apply the patch WSO2-CARBON-PATCH-4.4.0-0398 for API Manager 2.0.0. Follow the instructions in the README file inside the patch. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
