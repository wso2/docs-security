### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.0.0
* WSO2 App Manager 1.2.0

### OVERVIEW
Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists during the object de-serialization in Apache Commons Collection 3.2.1.


### DESCRIPTION
The Apache Commons Collections library contains various classes in the **functor** package which are serializable and use reflection. This can be exploited for remote code execution attacks by injecting specially crafted objects to applications that de-serialize java objects from untrusted sources.


### IMPACT
If you have an endpoint that accepts serialized Java objects (JMX, RMI, remote EJB, ...) you can combine the two to create arbitrary remote code execution vulnerability. By exploiting the vulnerability, the end user would be able to execute commands on the WSO2 server.
