### OVERVIEW
WSO2 products are vulnerable to possible server shut down through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.


### DESCRIPTION
The attack involves tricking a privileged user to initiate a request to shut down WSO2 Servers.


### IMPACT
The WSO2 servers are exposed to known vulnerabilities of Apache Tomcat versions prior to 7.0.69.


### SOLUTION
The CSRF Valve improved to differentiate between the malicious requests from the legitimate requests by validating the referer header of the incoming request.

Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
