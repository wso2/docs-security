### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.0.0
* WSO2 App Manager 1.2.0
* WSO2 Application Server 5.3.0
* WSO2 Business Rules Server 2.1.0
* WSO2 Dashboard Server 2.0.0
* WSO2 Message Broker 3.1.0


### OVERVIEW
An Open Redirect vulnerability is discovered in the Carbon Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
The following pages in the management console were found to be vulnerable to open redirect attacks, in the products mentioned here.

* XACML Policy Administration
* Identity Provider Management
* Workflow Management
* User Management

An attacker can attack the above UI components, by modifying some query parameters that contain a URL value in the management console context. They can modify the respective query parameter value such that the management console will redirect the request to the specified URL.

### IMPACT
An attacker aware of the management console origin, can modify the query parameter values to a URL value of a malicious site, and trick a user to invoke the modified URL via email or a neutral website. This redirects the user to the malicious site and the attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials or other sensitive information, or harm in any other way.
