### OVERVIEW
Upgrade the embedded Apache Tomcat version to 7.0.69 to support Tomcat-level security fixes and Security Headers in HTTP Responses.


### DESCRIPTION
With the Apache Tomcat upgrade, the following Common Vulnerability Exposures are fixed.

* CVE-2015-5174 : Limited directory traversal
* CVE-2015-5345 : Directory disclosure
* CVE-2015-5346 : Session Fixation
* CVE-2015-5351 : CSRF token leak
* CVE-2016-0706 : Security Manager bypass
* CVE-2016-0714 : Security Manager bypass

Supportability for following security headers in HTTP responses is also added with the upgrade.

* Strict-Transport-Security
* X-Frame-Options
* X-Content-Type-Options
* X-XSS-Protection


### IMPACT
The WSO2 servers are exposed to known vulnerabilities of Apache Tomcat versions prior to 7.0.69.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/).

For some of the products, there may be two patches (kernel patch and platform patch) that need to be applied. In such situations refrain from restarting the server for each patch, rather apply both patches and then restart the server.

If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
