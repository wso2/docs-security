### OVERVIEW
Apache Axis2 1.6.2 and earlier versions do not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (subjectAltName) field of the X.509 certificate.


### DESCRIPTION
Apache Axis2 1.6.2 uses commons-httpclient-3.1.0 and host name verification should be enabled in the commons-httpclient.


### IMPACT
This allows Eavesdropper attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
