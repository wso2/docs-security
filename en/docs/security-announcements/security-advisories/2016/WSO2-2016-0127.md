<p class="doc-info">Published: September 30, 2016</p>

### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Dashboard Server 2.0.0
* WSO2 Enterprise Mobility Manager 2.0.1


### OVERVIEW
The login page of the **authenticationendpoint** web application of the above-mentioned WSO2 Servers is vulnerable to XSS attacks.


### DESCRIPTION
The login page hosted in the WSO2 server's **authenticationendpoint** web application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks, which enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into that page. The respective page used a weak output encoding mechanism which was not sufficient to escape malicious user inputs properly.


### IMPACT
An attacker aware of the authentication endpoint origin can include malicious content in a request to login page and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral website. This reflects the attack on the userâ€™s browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
