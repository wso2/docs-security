### OVERVIEW
The secondary JDBC user store connection test option in the management console of the above-mentioned WSO2 Servers exposes sensitive data in URL query parameters.

### DESCRIPTION
Testing the connection from the WSO2 server's management console while adding a secondary JDBC user store initiates an HTTP GET request, including the connection credentials in URL query parameters. Thus, database connection credentials get exposed and also get logged in HTTP access logs.


### IMPACT
An attacker can steal database credentials and abuse the system if access is obtained to view access logs or browser history as all sensitive information to the respective connection including the credentials are exposed in HTTP access logs and URL query parameters.
