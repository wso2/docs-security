### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.0.0
* WSO2 Message Broker 3.1.0


### OVERVIEW
The carbon Metrics UI of the above WSO2 products is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.

### DESCRIPTION
Several XSS vulnerabilities were discovered in the Carbon Metrics component of WSO2 products. An attacker can possibly attack the management console, via that component, using reflected XSS. He can inject malicious scripts as a part of the URL which will be reflected in that component's pages.


### IMPACT
An attacker aware of the management console origin can include malicious content in a request to Carbon Metrics UI pages, and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral website. This reflects the attack back to the user's browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
