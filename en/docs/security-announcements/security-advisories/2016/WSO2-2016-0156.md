### OVERVIEW
Some of the Login forms in WSO2 products auto-complete the passwords in the userâ€™s web browser when the password is stored in the browser.


### DESCRIPTION
When a new username and password are entered into a form and the form is submitted, the browser asks if the password should be saved. Thereafter when the form is displayed, the username and password are filled in automatically or are completed as the username is entered.


### IMPACT
When the password field can be cached in the browser, an attacker with local access could obtain the cleartext password from the browser cache.
