### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server: 7.1.0


### OVERVIEW
Potential broken authorization via Attribute Configurations.


### DESCRIPTION
The “Attribute Configurations” controls offered via the Console application are applicable only to the UI profiles, while the backend APIs continue to follow the standard schema mutability [1]. Hence, there is no server-side enforcement change; instead, the product documentation has been updated [2] to clarify this behavior and avoid misinterpretation or related operational risks.

This issue doesn't introduce a new vulnerability or change server-side behavior. However, the lack of clear documentation might have caused misunderstandings about the feature's functionality, potentially exposing deployments to risks due to gaps in authorization controls.
