### OVERVIEW
Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) has been identified in the carbon console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper output encoding, a Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out by injecting a malicious payload through the XML input.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
