### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server: 7.1.0


### OVERVIEW
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) has been identified in the authentication endpoint.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper output encoding, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out by injecting a malicious payload through an unrestricted user input.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser, or cause harm otherwise. However, since all the session-related sensitive cookies are set with the httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
