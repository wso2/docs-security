### OVERVIEW
Unauthorized access to service provider via the deactivated tenant.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the improper tenant status validation, users in the deactivated tenant can continually access the service provider when it is configured to use Client Credential grant type or an External Federated Identity Provider even though the tenant status is deactivated.


### IMPACT
By leveraging this vulnerability a malicious actor could get unauthorized access for the data and services which are no longer available for users in the deactivated tenant. However the vulnerable behavior only exists when the service provider is configured to access using Client Credential Grant Type or External Federated Identity Provider.


### SOLUTION

#### Community Users (Open Source)
Migrate to the latest unaffected version of the respective WSO2 product(s).
