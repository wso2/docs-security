### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server: 7.1.0


### OVERVIEW
Potential account takeover vulnerability via adaptive authentication in multi-organization deployments.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to not validating the organization context when executing adaptive authentication flows, a malicious actor with access to configure adaptive authentication within one organization is able to leverage the functionality to trigger authentication logic on other organizations and sub-organizations. This flaw allows bypassing authorization boundaries between organizations, leading to unauthorized access to critical operations and user accounts in other organizations.


### IMPACT
When adaptive authentication is enabled in a multi-organization deployment, a malicious actor with privileges to configure adaptive authentication in one organization could exploit this feature to perform critical operations in other organizations without authorization. This may result in privilege escalation, unauthorized access to resources, and potential account takeover across organizations.
