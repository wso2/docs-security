### OVERVIEW
Potential Security Risk Due to Unvalidated Inputs in Signup Process.


### DESCRIPTION
The lack of adequate input validation in the user self-signup flow allows arbitrary unvalidated data to be included in user claims. This poses potential security risks for any downstream processes or functionalities that rely on these claims as they may inadvertently process malicious or malformed inputs.


### IMPACT
Allowing unvalidated input in the self-signup flow introduces the risk of injecting unexpected or malicious content into user claims. This could result in security issues such as content manipulation redirection or user interface inconsistencies which may mislead users. Furthermore if the input is processed unsafely in other parts of the application it could enable attacks such as unauthorized actions and data exposure. The severity of these risks depends on how the compromised data is consumed by downstream systems and the privileges associated with affected users.
