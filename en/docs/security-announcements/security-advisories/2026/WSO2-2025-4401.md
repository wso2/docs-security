### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Control Plane: 4.5.0
* WSO2 API Manager: 4.5.0, 4.4.0, 4.3.0, 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.0
* WSO2 Traffic Manager: 4.5.0
* WSO2 Universal Gateway: 4.5.0


### OVERVIEW
Improper access control permits Gateway API invocation using Internal/Everyone role.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the improper permission check, users with the Internal/Everyone role can invoke the Gateway APIs which may lead to unauthorized access on the deployment.

Additionally, this same vulnerability leads to bypassing access control checks for Internal Service APIs. Exploiting Internal Service APIs via the Traffic Manager is highly improbable in APIM 4.x versions as it is not externally exposed. However, in APIM 3.x versions Internal Service APIs may be accessible externally exposing the vulnerable endpoints.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the identified issue, a malicious actor with a valid user account on the vulnerable deployment could perform sensitive operations against Gateway REST API [1] regardless of their actual roles or privileges. This opens up the possibility for unintended behavior or misuse, especially in production environments.
