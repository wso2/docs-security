!!! warning caution attention
    WSO2 proactively issues security patches for all the supported product versions listed under WSO2 [Support Matrix](https://wso2.com/products/support-matrix/) ("available" and "deprecated" status). The vulnerability may affect older product versions that are in extended and discontinued statuses as well.


### OVERVIEW
Broken access control vulnerability has been identified on some API endpoints.


### DESCRIPTION
When the notification based password recovery is enabled [1][2], A malicious actor could manipulate the REST API path and bypass authentication checks relevant to some Rest APIs.


### IMPACT
Considering that some critical API endpoints are affected by this vulnerability, the successful exploitation could allow a malicious authenticated actor to impersonate and authenticate as a different targeted user (including an administrator, given the username of the administrator user is known to the malicious actor).


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to apply the provided patch/update to the affected versions of the products. If there are any instructions given with the patch/update, please make sure those are followed properly.
