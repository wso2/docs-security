### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0


### OVERVIEW
A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified in the self-registration feature.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper output encoding, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out by injecting a malicious payload into the self-registration page.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
We highly recommend to migrate the latest version of WSO2 Identity Server to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
