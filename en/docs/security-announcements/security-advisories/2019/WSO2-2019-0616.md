### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Datasource creation page of the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
A reflected XSS attack could be performed in the Datasource creation page of the Management Console by sending an HTTP GET request with a harmful request parameter.


### IMPACT
An attacker can trick a privileged user to click a crafted URL via email or a neutral website, then the attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.

Download the relevant patches based on the products you use following the matrix below. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/).
