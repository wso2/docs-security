### OVERVIEW
A potential Open Redirect vulnerability has been identified in account recovery and self-sign up flow.


### DESCRIPTION
Open Redirect vulnerability is discovered during account recovery and self-sign up flow, where the page will be redirected directly to the callback URL in the request which can be a malicious one.


### IMPACT
An attacker can modify the query parameter value to a URL value of a malicious site, and trick a user to invoke the modified URL. This redirects the user to the malicious site and the attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials or other sensitive information.
