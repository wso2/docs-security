### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0


### OVERVIEW
API Store is vulnerable to a potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.


### DESCRIPTION
The XSS vulnerability is discovered in the Forum feature of the Store application.


### IMPACT
The exploitability of the vulnerabilities is less as there are multiple steps associated with the flow. In the event of a successful attack, the injected script would get executed in the user's browser, which may generate malicious page results that would mislead the victim or harm otherwise.
