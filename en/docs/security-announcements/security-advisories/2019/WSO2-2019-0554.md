### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Event Processor UI of the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
The vulnerability is identified in the flow of validating siddhi execution plans.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attack would not be possible.
