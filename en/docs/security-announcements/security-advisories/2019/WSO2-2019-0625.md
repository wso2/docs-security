### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 IS as Key Manager
* WSO2 Identity Server


### OVERVIEW
An unauthenticated reflected XSS and a stored XSS in the dashboard user profile.


### DESCRIPTION
A reflected XSS attack could be performed in the dashboard user profile by sending an HTTP GET request with harmful request parameters. Further, a stored XSS attack could be performed in the download-userinfo. jag due to an improper Content-Type of the downloading content.


### IMPACT
An attacker can trick a privileged user to click a crafted URL via email, IM or a neutral website, then the attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.

Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
