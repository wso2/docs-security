### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Enterprise Integrator


### OVERVIEW
Providing users with an option to disable the try-it functionality.


### DESCRIPTION
If the try-it service is exposed publicly without authentication, it leads to facilitate Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.


### IMPACT
An attacker can leverage SSRF to access services.


### SOLUTION
Upgrade the product to 6.5.0 or a higher version, which is not affected by this SSRF vulnerability. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.

!!! info todo
    It is highly recommended to migrate older versions of the WSO2 products to the [latest released version](https://wso2.com/products/carbon/release-matrix/) to receive security fixes.
