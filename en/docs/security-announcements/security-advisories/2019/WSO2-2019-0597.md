### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the event simulator component.


### DESCRIPTION
This vulnerability can be exploited in the file-uploading feature of the event simulator component. An attacker can upload the file in event simulator feature with the malicious script as a file name which leads to an XSS attack.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attack would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
