### OVERVIEW
Potential stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been identified in the registry UI.

### DESCRIPTION
When a user adds a new registry resource, a malicious user could inject an executable script as input in the registry UI which leads to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
