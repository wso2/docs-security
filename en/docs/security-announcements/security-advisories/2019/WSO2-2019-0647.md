### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager


### OVERVIEW
A potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the **implement phase** of the API Publisher.


### DESCRIPTION
A stored XSS attack could be performed in implement phase of creating an API by sending an HTTP POST request with a harmful request parameter for context.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
