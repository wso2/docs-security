### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager
* WSO2 IS as Key Manager
* WSO2 Identity Server


### OVERVIEW
A possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been detected in the management console.


### DESCRIPTION
When a custom claim dialect with an XSS payload is configured in the identity provider basic claim configuration, that payload gets executed, if a user picks up the malicious dialect URI as the provisioning claim in advanced claim configuration of the same Identity Provider. The attacker also needs to have privileges to log in to the management console, add and update identity provider configurations.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.

Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
