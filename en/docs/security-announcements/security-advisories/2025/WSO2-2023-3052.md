### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0, 4.0.0
* WSO2 Micro integrator 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 1.2.0


### OVERVIEW
XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the PayloadFactory mediator.


### DESCRIPTION
XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability is possible when malicious user inputs are being parsed through the PayloadFactory Mediator.


### IMPACT
This will have an impact only if both of the following conditions are met:

* The deployment has a configured PayloadFactory mediator.  
* The attacker is aware of the configured PayloadFactory mediator sequence to craft a malicious payload.

In such a scenario, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability, a malicious actor can disclose local files, denial of service, server-side request forgery, port scanning and other system impacts on affected systems.


### SOLUTION

#### Community Users (Open Source)
We highly recommend to migrate to the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
