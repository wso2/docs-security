### OVERVIEW
Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper validation, a user with publisher privileges can exploit a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability by uploading an API document file to the Publisher.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
