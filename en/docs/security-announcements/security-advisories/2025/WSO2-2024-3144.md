### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0
* WSO2 Identity Server 6.1.0, 6.0.0


### OVERVIEW
A local user can be impersonated when using federated authentication with Silent JIT Provisioning.


### DESCRIPTION
When the 'Silent Just-In-Time Provisioning' feature is enabled for a federated identity provider (IDP), there is a risk that a local user store user’s information may be replaced during the account provisioning process in cases where federated users share the same username as local users.


### IMPACT
There will be no impact on your deployment if any of the preconditions mentioned below are not met. Only when all the preconditions mentioned below are fulfilled could a malicious actor associate a targeted local user account with a federated IDP user account that they control.

* The Deployment should have:

    * An IDP configured for federated authentication with Silent JIT provisioning enabled.

* The malicious actor should have: 

    * A fresh valid user account in the federated IDP that has not been used earlier. 
    * Knowledge of the username of a valid user in the local IDP. 
    * An account at the federated IDP matching the targeted local username.
