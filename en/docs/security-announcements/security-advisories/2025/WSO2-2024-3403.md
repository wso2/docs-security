### OVERVIEW
Open redirection vulnerability has been identified.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the lack of validation in the callback url, malicious actors may perform an open redirection vulnerability in some circumstances.


### IMPACT
By using social engineering techniques, an attacker could persuade a user to click on a valid link (but with a malicious payload) and get the user redirected to an attacker controlled page where a phishing attack could be executed to obtain highly sensitive information or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION

#### Community Users (Open Source)
We highly recommend to migrate to the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
