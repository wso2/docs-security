### OVERVIEW
A Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the improper input validation, a remote code execution attack could be carried out via certain admin operations which requires configuring a 'JDBC user store'.


### IMPACT
In order to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious actor should have a valid user account which has administrative access to the Management Console and should be able to reach it (WSO2 Security Guidelines for Production Deployment [1] recommends not to publicly expose the Management Console). If such access could be obtained, a malicious actor could execute arbitrary code on the server running the H2 database engine. Execution will occur with the permissions assigned to the user running the H2 database engine. In the case of the H2 database instance embedded in WSO2 products, this is the user running the WSO2 product.
