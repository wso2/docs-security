### OVERVIEW
Potential cross-tenant account takeover vulnerability via adaptive authentication and auto-login.


### DESCRIPTION
A single cryptographic key is used across all tenants to sign cookies generated by Adaptive Authentication. As a result, a privileged user from one tenant can forge the authentication cookies of users in other tenants. Because the Auto-Login feature is enabled by default, this allows for unauthorized access and potential account takeover across multiple tenants.


### IMPACT
A successful attack could allow an attacker to compromise a victimâ€™s account and impersonate them. However, exploiting this vulnerability requires specific privileges to utilize the Adaptive Authentication feature, a level of access generally limited to a small number of high-privileged users within WSO2 products. Additionally, the issue only arises if the Auto-Login feature is enabled. As a result, the practical likelihood of exploitation remains low under these narrow conditions.


### SOLUTION

#### Community Users (Open Source)
We highly recommend to migrate to the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.


#### Support Subscription Holders
