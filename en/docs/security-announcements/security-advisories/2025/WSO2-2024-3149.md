### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server: 6.1.0, 6.0.0, 5.11.0


### OVERVIEW
Potential brute force vulnerability due to non-expiring SMS OTPs.


### DESCRIPTION
The lack of a default expiry time for SMS OTPs in MFA allows them to remain valid indefinitely if unused, posing a security risk. This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious actor to perform brute force attacks. To mitigate this risk, a default expiry period for SMS OTPs in MFA has been implemented.


### IMPACT
The absence of automatic expiration for OTPs allows attackers unlimited time to guess the correct code, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. A successful attack could result in an MFA bypass, leading to the complete takeover of the userâ€™s account, thereby jeopardizing the security and privacy of both the affected user and the entire system.


### SOLUTION

#### Community Users (Open Source)
We highly recommend to migrate to the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
