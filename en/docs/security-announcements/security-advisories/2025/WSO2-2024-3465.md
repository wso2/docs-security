### OVERVIEW
Security enhancements to block sensitive data from being sent via URL parameters.


### DESCRIPTION
This update provides critical enhancements to WSO2 products by blocking the use of sending sensitive data via URL parameters in any flows. Although WSO2 products did not utilize sensitive data via URL parameters, users could forcefully send them this way, which could lead to sensitive data being logged in access logs.


### IMPACT
WSO2 products did not use URL parameters to send sensitive data in any flows. However, if a user mistakenly used to send sensitive data to any flow, sensitive data could inadvertently be logged in access logs. This could lead to the exposure of confidential information, potentially compromising the security and privacy of the affected systems if the product was used incorrectly.
