### OVERVIEW
Potential Expression Language (EL) injection vulnerability has been identified.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the lack of input validation in the user submitted data, a malicious actor may submit malicious code via user input and perform arbitrary operations on the deployment.


### IMPACT
However, the malicious actor must have administrator privileges to exploit the identified vulnerable flow in WSO2 products. Additionally, successful exploitation has minimal impact on WSO2 products, as expression language usage is restricted to certain read operations.
