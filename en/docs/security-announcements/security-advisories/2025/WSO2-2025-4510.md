### OVERVIEW
Arbitrary code execution with higher privileged users via GraalJS and NashornJS Script Mediator engines.


### DESCRIPTION
A malicious authenticated actor with higher privileges can execute arbitrary code due to a lack of controls on the GraalJS and NashornJS Script Mediator engines. 

By default, access to Script Mediator engines is limited to administrators in WSO2 Micro Integrator and WSO2 Enterprise Integrator, while in WSO2 API Manager it is available to both administrators and API creators.

!!! Note
    The previously issued advisory [WSO2-2023-2938](https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2024/WSO2-2023-2938/) addresses the Rhino mediation engine. Please refer to that advisory for additional details. The current advisory (WSO2-2025-4510) provides the required steps to secure Rhino, GraalJS, and NashornJS in script mediation by allowing or blocking Java classes. However, Java method-based allow listing or block listing is not applicable to GraalJS or NashornJS. This functionality is only supported by Rhino discussed in [WSO2-2023-2938](https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2024/WSO2-2023-2938/).


### IMPACT
By leveraging the vulnerability, a malicious actor may perform an arbitrary remote code execution attack.

Once you apply the fix using one of the methods mentioned above, it is necessary to follow the instructions provided below according to your specific requirements.

If the Script Mediator is not required for your business use cases, add the following configuration to the `deployment.toml` file to safeguard your deployment by preventing the execution of script mediation engines. 
Edit the file at the product-specific path:
* WSO2 API Manager: <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml
* WSO2 Micro Integrator: <PRODUCT_HOME>/conf/deployment.toml

```toml
[synapse_properties]
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.enable' = true
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.list_type' = "BLOCK_LIST"
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.class_prefixes' = "java.lang,java.io,java.nio,java.net"
```

If you have use cases which require usage of Java classes in the Script Mediator, you may fine tune Class level access as detailed below, depending on the use case of the mediation sequence.

We have provided a sample configuration based on the use case where the mediation sequence requires usage of `java.util.ArrayList` class.

```javascript
var s = new java.util.ArrayList();
```

#### Configuration: 

In WSO2 API Manager and WSO2 Micro Integrator, you can configure the above policy in the `deployment.toml` file:

* For API Manager: <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml
* For Micro Integrator: <PRODUCT_HOME>/conf/deployment.toml

```toml
[synapse_properties]
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.enable' = true
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.list_type' = "ALLOW_LIST"
# Prefixes of class names, to be allowed or blocked (based on 'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.list_type')
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.class_prefixes' = "java.util.ArrayList"
```

Similar to `ALLOW_LIST`, you can also use a `BLOCK_LIST` as follows, to specifically block only the usage of `java.lang.Runtime` class. 

```toml
[synapse_properties]
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.enable' = true
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.list_type' = "BLOCK_LIST"
# Prefixes of class names, to be allowed or blocked (based on 'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.list_type')
'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.class_prefixes' = "java.lang.Runtime"
```

In WSO2 Enterprise Integrator, the above mentioned policy can be configured in the `<EI_HOME>/conf/synapse.properties` as follows:

```toml
limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.enable = true
limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.list_type = ALLOW_LIST
# Prefixes of class names, to be allowed or blocked (based on 'limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.list_type')
limit_java_class_access_in_scripts.class_prefixes = java.util.ArrayList
```

Please refer to that advisory for additional details. The current advisory (WSO2-2025-4510) provides the required steps to secure Rhino, GraalJS, and NashornJS in script mediation by allowing or blocking Java classes. However, Java method-based allow listing or block listing is not applicable to GraalJS or NashornJS. This functionality is only supported by Rhino, which is already covered under [WSO2-2023-2938](https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2024/WSO2-2023-2938/).
