### AFFECTED PRODUCTS

### OVERVIEW
A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified on Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the lack of output encoding in the management console's user search function, malicious actors may exploit this vulnerability to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
