### OVERVIEW
Refresh token grant continuously works for the user accounts which are blocked by the userstore.


### DESCRIPTION
User accounts that are locked by the user store are still usable to obtain access tokens, if the refresh grant type is enabled. This issue bypasses account lock protections, leading to unauthorized access in scenarios where account locks should prevent token generation.


### IMPACT
This vulnerability may result in unauthorized access, as locked accounts can retrieve access tokens. It poses a risk of privilege escalation or data leakage, depending on the scope of use of the refresh grant type in affected deployments.

In addition to applying the U2 update or public PR, the following configurations should be also added to the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` to enable the account locking status check at the userstore level during the generation of new access tokens via the refresh grant.

```toml
[oauth.token_renewal]
validate_authenticated_user_for_refresh_grant = true
```
Please note that the account lock status check at the user store level during the refresh grant flow is disabled by default, as enabling it may impact performance.
