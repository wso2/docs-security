### OVERVIEW
A potential denial of service vulnerability.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to lack of input validation in the AJAX processor, the request attribute counts could cause time and resource consuming repetitive processing (loops), which could result in denial of service.


### IMPACT
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks have the potential to overwhelm the deployment, resulting in either partial or full service disruptions. Depending on the exploitation techniques and volume, the vulnerability could slow down accessibility to produce functions or, in more extreme cases, render the product unavailable.


### SOLUTION

#### Community Users (Open Source)
We highly recommend to migrate to the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.


#### Support Subscription Holders

Update your product to the specified update level—or a higher update level—to apply the fix.
