### OVERVIEW
Authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been identified in SOAP services.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper validation of user input for filenames at the BPEL uploader service endpoint, a malicious actor with administrative privileges could upload arbitrary files to a user-controlled location on the server. By leveraging this vulnerability, it is possible to gain remote code execution on the server.


### IMPACT
A malicious actor with administrative privileges may perform remote code execution by uploading a specially crafted payload through the vulnerable endpoint, potentially compromising the server and its data.
