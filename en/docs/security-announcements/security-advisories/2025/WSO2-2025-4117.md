### OVERVIEW
Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Admin Services.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the use of the HTTP GET method for a state-changing operation in the event processor of the carbon console, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists. Although the service endpoints rely on the SameSite=Lax cookie attribute for CSRF mitigation, this mechanism is ineffective in this context, as SameSite=Lax allows cookies to be sent with cross-origin top-level navigation requests, including GET requests. As a result, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. However, according to WSO2 Secure Production Guidelines [^1], **exposing the Carbon console and related services to the public internet is not recommended.**


### IMPACT
By leveraging the CSRF attack, a malicious actor can trick an authenticated user’s browser into unknowingly executing unintended actions on a vulnerable web application. This may result in unauthorized operations such as data modification, account changes, or other state-altering requests, potentially leading to data compromise, privilege escalation, or loss of user control over their account.
