### OVERVIEW
Broken Authentication Vulnerability.


### DESCRIPTION
Broken Authentication vulnerability occurs when **StartTLSEnabled** property is set to `true` in the LDAP user store configuration.


### IMPACT
This vulnerability allows anyone to log in if a valid username is known. However, **StartTLSEnabled** is not set to `true` by default. Therefore, a deployment is not impacted unless that configuration is turned on explicitly.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):

* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-kernel/pull/2835](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-kernel/pull/2835)
