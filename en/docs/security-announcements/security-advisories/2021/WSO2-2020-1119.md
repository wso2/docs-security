### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 2.2.0 , 2.5.0 , 2.6.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in API Store.


### DESCRIPTION
A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability can be exploited by sending an unauthenticated request with a malicious payload to the password reset component of the API Store Web Portal.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. In addition, it should be assumed that the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is also impacted. However, since the session related sensitive cookies are set with the httpOnly flag and protected, a session hijacking attack would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If you are using an affected product version, it is highly recommended to migrate to the latest released version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
