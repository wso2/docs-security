### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 3.1.0 or earlier
* WSO2 IS as Key Manager : 5.9.0 , 5.10.0


### OVERVIEW
Improper authorization check when accessing API resources.


### DESCRIPTION
API Gateway does not properly validate the token scope when accessing a resource with a trailing slash (e.g. "/foo/").


### IMPACT
This vulnerability has an impact only if the resource has a trailing slash (e.g. "/foo/"). If such is the case, this allows attackers to bypass the intended access restrictions of the scope protected resources. This could lead to confidentiality, integrity and availability impact on the back-end services, depending on the provided functionalities and the security controls in place.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
