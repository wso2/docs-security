### OVERVIEW
A potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability


### DESCRIPTION
An XML External Entity (XXE) attack abuses a widely available but rarely used feature of XML parsers to access sensitive information.


### IMPACT
The resolution of external entity references is enabled. Therefore, if attacker-controlled XML is submitted to the XML parser, then the attacker could gain access to information about an internal network, local filesystem, or other sensitive data.
