### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 2.2.0 , 2.5.0 , 2.6.0


### OVERVIEW
A Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the API Store.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to an improper output encoding, a Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out by an attacker injecting a malicious payload into API Publisher which will get reflected and malform the output in the API Store.


### IMPACT
In order to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious actor should have a valid user account of the API Publisher. If such access could be obtained, they could make a change that impacts other users viewing the affected APIs using the API Store. The possible impacts include, getting the browser redirected to a malicious website, making changes in the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with **httpOnly** flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
