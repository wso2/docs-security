### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* API Manager : 2.2.0 , 2.6.0 , 3.0.0 , 3.1.0 , 3.2.0 , 4.0.0


### OVERVIEW
Unauthenticated access to non-sensitive registry resources.


### DESCRIPTION
It is possible to download non-sensitive registry resources such as API documentation and API icons without being authenticated.


### IMPACT
By leveraging this vulnerability, a person can access the particular registry resources of API documentation without authenticating to the management console.


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to block these request URL paths from the LB level. Please allow only **/registry/resource/_system/governance/apimgt/applicationdata/icons** and block all other paths starting from **/registry**. The Icon path is used to display thumbnail icons in APIs hence it is required to be allowed. When it comes to API Manager 3.x and newer versions, the entire **/registry** path can be blocked from the LB level.
