### OVERVIEW
A Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper output encoding, a Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out by an attacker injecting a malicious payload into the Registry feature of the Management Console.


### IMPACT
In order to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious actor should have a valid user account of the Management Console. If such access could be obtained, they could make a change that impacts other users viewing the affected UIs of Registry feature. The possible impacts include getting the browser redirected to a malicious website, making changes in the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with **httpOnly** flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):
