### OVERVIEW
A Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to an improper output encoding, a Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out by an attacker injecting a malicious payload into the Registry feature of the Management Console.


### IMPACT
In order to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious actor should have a valid user account of the Management Console. If such access could be obtained, they could make a change that impacts other users viewing the affected UIs of Registry feature. The possible impacts include, getting the browser redirected to a malicious website, making changes in the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with **httpOnly** flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes.
