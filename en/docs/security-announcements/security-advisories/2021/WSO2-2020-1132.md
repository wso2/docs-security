### OVERVIEW
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Reflected XSS vulnerability can be exploited by tampering with a request parameter in Management Console. This can be performed in both authenticated and unauthenticated requests.


### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes.

Otherwise, community users may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix(s):

* [https://github.com/wso2/carbon-kernel/pull/2796](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-kernel/pull/2796)
