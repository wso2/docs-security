### AFFECTED PRODUCTS

* WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0  or earlier


### OVERVIEW
One Time Password (OTP) usage in multi-factor authentication is vulnerable to brute force attacks.


### DESCRIPTION
When an OTP authenticator is configured as part of multi-factor authentication, it is possible to attempt brute forcing the OTP since those authenticators do not have a mechanism to prevent multiple failed attempts.


### IMPACT
The probability of successful exploitation of this vulnerability is quite low because; 

a. The attacker needs to bypass the other steps in the authentication chain prior to this attack.

b. The complexity of a brute force attack depends on the number of digits of OTPs. 

If an attacker succeeds in brute forcing an OTP, it might be possible to gain access to the application by impersonating it as a legitimate user. There could be an impact on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected application based on the functionality provided to the user.


### SOLUTION
