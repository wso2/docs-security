### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* API Microgateway Toolkit Linux : 3.2.0
* API Microgateway Toolkit Mac : 3.2.0
* API Microgateway Toolkit Windows : 3.2.0


### OVERVIEW
An improper certification validation vulnerability leading to possible malicious code execution.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to an improper certification validation a malicious actor could perform a person-in-the-middle attack by manipulating Ballerina dependencies when retrieving such from the Ballerina Central. This retrieval happens when building the microgateway using the **micro-gw build** command.


### IMPACT
In order for the attack to succeed, an malicious actor should be able to perform a person-in-the-middle attack on the TLS connection, and alter response traffic relevant to the communication in between the host executing 'micro-gw build' command and the Ballerina Central. By leveraging the vulnerability, a malicious actor may perform an Remote Code Execution by injecting a malicious code into the system.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes.
