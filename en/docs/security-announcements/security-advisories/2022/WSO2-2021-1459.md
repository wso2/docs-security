### OVERVIEW
Improper authentication in the TOTP Rest API.


### DESCRIPTION
TOTP API can be accessed using the user username and the password of a user, due to the improper authentication in the TOTP Rest API.


### IMPACT
This vulnerability only impacts authentication flows where TOTP authenticator is used. Additionally, in order to leverage this vulnerability a malicious actor should have the valid username and password of the targeted victim. If such information could be obtained, a malicious actor can invoke the TOTP endpoint using the username and password of the victim. Doing so, the malicious actor could get the TOTP code which can be used to bypass the TOTP authentication.
