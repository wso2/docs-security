### OVERVIEW
Improper authentication in the FIDO Rest API.


### DESCRIPTION
FIDO API can be accessed using the username and the password of a user, due to the improper authentication in the FIDO Rest API.


### IMPACT
This vulnerability only impacts authentication flows where the FIDO authenticator is used. Additionally, in order to leverage this vulnerability a malicious actor should have the valid username and password of the targeted victim. If such information could be obtained, a malicious actor can invoke the FIDO endpoint using the username and password of the victim. Doing so, the malicious actor could register malicious devices to bypass FIDO authentication.
