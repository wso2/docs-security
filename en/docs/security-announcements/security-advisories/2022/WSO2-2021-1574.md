### OVERVIEW
Potential sensitive information disclosure via log files when JMS connection failure occurs.


### DESCRIPTION
When special characters are contained in JMS connection credentials, JMS connection string (including credentials) are logged to "wso2carbon" log during JMS connection failures.


### IMPACT
In order to leverage this vulnerability, a malicious actor should have the privileges to access the "wso2carbon" log files. If such access is obtained, a malicious actor could obtain the JMS connection credentials from log files, given the following conditions:

* JMS connection credentials must contain special characters.
* There were JMS connection failures that resulted in persisting the connection string (with credentials) to the log file.


### SOLUTION
