### OVERVIEW
A potential open redirection vulnerability in callback URL.


### DESCRIPTION
The WSO2 Secure Deployment guide recommended regex callback URI validation is vulnerable to potential open redirection vulnerability.


### IMPACT
By using social engineering techniques, an attacker could persuade a user to click on a valid link (but with a malicious payload) and get the user redirected to an attacker controlled page where a phishing attack could be executed to obtain highly sensitive information or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
In order to mitigate the identified vulnerability, It is highly recommended to apply the below given configuration into the following function following path.

Service Provider > Add/Edit Service Provider > Inbound Authentication Configuration > OAuth/OpenIDConnect Configuration > Configure

  `Callback URL => regexp=(https://((example1\.com)|(example2:8000))(/callback))`

Here example1 and example2 are sample URLs

Moreover, the product documentation is updated with the corrected configuration samples.
