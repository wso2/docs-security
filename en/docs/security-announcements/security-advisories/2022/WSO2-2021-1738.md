!!! warning caution attention
    WSO2 proactively issues security patches for all the supported product versions listed under WSO2 [Support Matrix](https://wso2.com/products/support-matrix/) ("available" and "deprecated" status). The vulnerability may affect older product versions that are in extended and discontinued statuses as well.

### OVERVIEW

Unrestricted arbitrary file upload, and remote code to execution vulnerability.

### DESCRIPTION

Due to improper validation of user input, a malicious actor could upload an arbitrary file to a user controlled location of the server. By leveraging the arbitrary file upload vulnerability, it is further possible to gain remote code execution on the server.

### IMPACT

By leveraging the vulnerability, a malicious actor may perform Remote Code Execution by uploading a specially crafted payload.

### SOLUTION

WSO2 has provided temporary mitigations to the customers in January 2022 and delivered the fixes for all the supported product versions listed under the WSO2 Support Matrix ("available" and "deprecated" status) in February.
