### OVERVIEW
Remote Code Execution on the server through adaptive authentication script.


### DESCRIPTION
For this vulnerability to have any impact on your deployment, the malicious actor should have one of the following permissions to exploit the vulnerability using Adaptive Authentication script:

* /permission/admin/manage/identity/applicationmgt/create
* /permission/admin/manage/identity/applicationmgt/update

If the malicious actor has **/permission/admin/manage** permission, the vulnerability can be exploited using function libraries. When the above preconditions are met, a malicious actor could gain access to the server by running malicious code.


### IMPACT
There is no impact on your deployment if all the preconditions mentioned in the description section are not met. If preconditions are met, by leveraging this vulnerability, a malicious actor may gain Remote Code Execution on the server. By doing so, the server data is at a high-risk, resulting in an impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.
