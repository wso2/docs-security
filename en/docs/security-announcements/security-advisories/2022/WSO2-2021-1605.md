### AFFECTED PRODUCTS

### OVERVIEW
Potential unauthorized profile update vulnerability in federated authentication with JIT provisioning when specific configurations are enabled.


### DESCRIPTION
For this vulnerability to have any impact on your deployment, the following conditions must be met:
* An IDP configured for federated authentication and JIT provisioning enabled with the "Prompt for username, password, and consent" option.

The malicious actor should have:
* Knowledge of the username of a valid user in the local IDP. In addition, the malicious actor should have an email address that must have the targeted user's username as an email prefix (<usernameOfTargetUserAccount\>@mail.com).

When all preconditions are met, a malicious actor could use JIT provisioning flow to change the victim's user profile information.


### IMPACT
There is no impact on your deployment if all the preconditions mentioned in the description section are not met. Only if all mentioned preconditions in the description section are met, a malicious actor could update a targeted local user account's email address with a federated IDP user account.

**However, it can be converted as an account takeover attack when the password recovery is enabled in the vulnerable deployment.**
