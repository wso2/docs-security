### OVERVIEW
Intermediate Certificate Validation is skipped for SCIM2 endpoints by default Authorization bypass due to improper default configuration of Intermediate Certificate Validation on SCIM2 endpoints.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the default configuration in WSO2 products, Intermediate Certificate Validation [^1] is skipped for SCIM2 endpoints. When a valid CA signed certificate is used in invocations, it could be used to access resources irrespective of the privileges of the user.


### IMPACT
In order to exploit this vulnerability, a malicious actor must have the private key of the Root CA, or a valid certificate signed by the Root CA and the associated private key. If such can be obtained, by leveraging this vulnerability, a malicious actor may invoke the SCIM2 endpoints. Such access could expose user information, and could cause confidentiality, integrity and availability impacts to targeted user records.


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to apply the following configuration that needs to be added into **<Product_Home\>/repository/conf/deployment.toml** file under the `[intermediate_cert_validation]` tag.
```toml
exempt_contexts=[]
```

**NoteIntermediate certificate validation is skipped for SCIM2 endpoints by default.** So you need to remove the default exempted SCIM2 context to overcome the vulnerability with the above configuration. Therefore if there is no explicit requirement, make exempt_contexts empty as shown above.
