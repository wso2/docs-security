### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Application Server 5.3.0
* WSO2 Data Services Server 3.5.1
* WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus 5.0.0
* WSO2 Message Broker 3.1.0


### OVERVIEW
The WSO2 Carbon WSDL Tool of the above-listed products has been identified to have an XSS vulnerability where a user can inject an executable script as user input.

### DESCRIPTION
In Carbon WSDL Tool, a reflected XSS attack can be performed when a user injects a malicious executable script as user input through the carbon management console.

This issue has been fixed in the affected component with the security patches given for specific products.


### IMPACT
An attacker can include malicious content in a request to Carbon WSDL Toolâ€™s wsdl2code page in the management console, and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral website. This reflects the attack back to the user's browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to apply relevant security patches which fix the XSS vulnerability identified in the specific components used in products.

See below for details on patching or updating the affected component.
