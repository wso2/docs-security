### OVERVIEW
A potential Stored XSS vulnerability has been identified in the WSO2 Server Roles Management UI component in the above-listed products where a user can inject an executable script as the server role name.

### DESCRIPTION
In several versions of the WSO2 Server Roles Management UI component, Stored XSS attack can be performed when a malicious user injects an executable script as server role name by HTTP PUT/POST requests. This vulnerability affects all versions above 4.2.0 of the WSO2 Carbon Server Roles Management UI component (org.wso2.carbon.roles.mgt.ui_4.x.x.jar). The WSO2-CARBON-PATCH-4.2.0-1464 is an already existing patch which fixes the problem in org.wso2.carbon.roles.mgt.ui_4.2.0.jar.

This issue has been fixed in version 4.3.0 and 4.4.x of the WSO2 Carbon Server Roles Management UI component with security patches given for specific product versions.


### IMPACT
As a consequence of the Stored XSS attack, the injected malicious script will appear to be part of the WSO2 Carbon **Server Role** web page, and will get executed within the user's browser whenever the web page is accessed. This leads to several malicious activities such as capturing sensitive information in the web pages, hijacking user session data and etc.


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to apply relevant security updates/patches which fix the XSS vulnerability in the WSO2 Carbon Server Roles Management UI component. See below for details on patching or updating the affected component.
