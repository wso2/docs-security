### AFFECTED PRODUCTS

* WSO2 Data Analytics Server 3.1.0
* WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus Analytics 5.0.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the Event Simulator, Event Tracer and Template Manager components of the above-listed products.


### DESCRIPTION
In several versions of Event Simulator, Event Tracer and Template manager components, potential reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability has been discovered.


### IMPACT
An attacker aware of the management console origin can include malicious content in a request and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral website. This reflects the attack back to the userâ€™s browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.
