### OVERVIEW
A potential vulnerability is detected in the Management Console of the above-listed products that let attackers bypass authentication to view a restricted web page.


### DESCRIPTION
With the identified vulnerability, an attacker can modify the file extension in the URL of a web page in the Management Console and view a restricted page without authentication, which should be visible only to authenticated and authorized users.


### IMPACT
Attackers can access pages that should be restricted by the administrators of the application. However, the attackers cannot view the content of the webpage, where it loads only the theme of the webpage, not even menu items; hence the risk is minimum.


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to apply relevant security updates/patches to products which fix the identified vulnerability in affected components.

See below for details on patching or updating the affected component.
