### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server 5.3.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
A Stored XSS attack could be performed in the Management Console by sending an HTTP POST request with a harmful script which gets stored in the database and later gets executed when trying to perform a UI action based on that data.

This has been possible due to the unavailability of proper encoding for the fields displayed in the web page.


### IMPACT
By performing a Stored XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attack would not be possible.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
