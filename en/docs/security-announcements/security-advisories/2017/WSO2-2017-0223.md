### OVERVIEW
The tenant creation page of the above WSO2 products, auto-completes the passwords in the user's web browser when the password is stored in the browser.

### DESCRIPTION
When a new username and password are entered in the tenant creation form and the form is submitted, the browser asks if the password should be saved. Thereafter when the form is displayed, the username and password are filled in automatically or are completed as the username is entered.

This fix adds the `autocomplete="off"` HTML flag to the password fields of the tenant creation form to instruct browsers not to perform password autocomplete. 


### IMPACT
When the password field can be cached in the browser, an attacker with local access could obtain the cleartext password from the browser cache.

!!! info todo
    Most modern browsers do not honor the `autocomplete="off"` HTML flag.

The recommended solution is to apply relevant security updates/patches to products which fix the identified vulnerability in affected components.
