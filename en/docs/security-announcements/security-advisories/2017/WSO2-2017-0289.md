### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 2.1.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability is detected in several pages of API Publisher, API Store and Admin web apps.


### DESCRIPTION
By leveraging the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker may trick the users into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. A successful CSRF attack can force the user (victim) to perform state-changing requests that the user is authorized to perform.


### IMPACT
An attacker can trick a privileged user to click a crafted URL via email, IM or a neutral website, then the attacker can make the browser to get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise.

However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
