### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
In Carbon Tenant Management UI, the identified XSS attack can be performed when a user injects a malicious executable script as a user input through the carbon management console.

This issue has been fixed in affected component versions with a security patch/update given for specific products.


### IMPACT
An attacker aware of the management console origin can include malicious content in a request and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral website. This reflects the attack back to the userâ€™s browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
