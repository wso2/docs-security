### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Dashboard Portal web application.


### DESCRIPTION
This addresses a potential XSS vulnerability identified in Dashboard Portal login-controller when Single Sign On is enabled. It has been identified that HTTP headers in the request can be injected with malicious payloads due to improper encoding before displaying the the web page.


### IMPACT
An attacker can include malicious content in a request to the Portal web application, and trick a user to click a crafted URL via email, IM or a neutral website. This reflects the attack back to the user's browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.
