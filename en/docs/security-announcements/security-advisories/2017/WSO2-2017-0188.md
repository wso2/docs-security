### OVERVIEW
The WSO2 Carbon New Data Sources UI component of the above-listed products has been identified to have a potential XSS vulnerability where a user can inject an executable script as user input.


### DESCRIPTION
In the Carbon New Data Sources UI component, reflected XSS attack vulnerability is detected when a user injects a malicious executable script as user input using the carbon management console.

This issue has been fixed in the affected component with security patches given for specific products.


### IMPACT
An attacker can include malicious content in a request to Carbon New Data Sources UI page of management console, and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral website. This reflects the attack back to the user's browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.
