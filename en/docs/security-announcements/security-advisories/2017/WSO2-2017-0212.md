### OVERVIEW
A potential sensitive data exposure vulnerability through the advanced search option is detected in the Management Console of the above-listed product versions.


### DESCRIPTION
In the Management Console **advancedSearch** parameters might contain sensitive information which will get logged in access_logs. Therefore, it is required to change the search form submission to HTTP POST in order to prevent logging sensitive information. This security fix will prevent logging sensitive information in access_logs.


### IMPACT
The user's sensitive information might be exposed through the http_access_logs and might be misused if it falls into the hands of an attacker.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
