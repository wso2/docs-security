### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
This vulnerability is discovered in the message dialog page of the Management Console. However, exploiting the vulnerability remotely is not possible as the malicious script should be injected into the input and the given input should be displayed back to the user in a message dialog box.


### IMPACT
By leveraging an XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise.

However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attack would not be possible.

Apply the following patches based on your product version by following the instructions in the README file. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
