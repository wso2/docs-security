### OVERVIEW
The WSO2 Carbon UI and Message Flows UI components of above listed products have been identified to have a potential XSS vulnerability where a user can inject an executable script as user input.


### DESCRIPTION
In WSO2 Carbon UI and Message Flows UI components, reflected XSS attack vulnerability is detected when a user injects a malicious executable script as user input when using carbon management console.

This issue has been fixed in affected components with security patches given for specific product versions.


### IMPACT
An attacker can include malicious content in a request to Carbon UI and Message Flows UI pages of management console, and trick a user to click the malicious content via email or a neutral website. This reflects the attack back to the userâ€™s browser and will execute the injected code, which may generate malicious page results that will mislead the victim or harm otherwise.
