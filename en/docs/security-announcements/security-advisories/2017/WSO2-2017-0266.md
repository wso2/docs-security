### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server 5.3.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been detected in Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Submitting a new entitlement policy set is an administrative functionality done through the management console. This should be only permitted with the HTTP POST method as it is a state-changing operation and all such operations are CSRF protected by default.

It has been found that the web page accepts GET requests as well, where the query parameters are not properly encoded when displayed.


### IMPACT
An attacker can trick a privileged user to click a crafted URL via email, IM or a neutral website, then the attacker can make the browser to get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise.

However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
