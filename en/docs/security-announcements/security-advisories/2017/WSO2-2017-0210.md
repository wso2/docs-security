### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 App Manager 1.2.0
* WSO2 Dashboard Server 2.0.0


### OVERVIEW
A potential authorization bypassing vulnerability is detected in the email templates page in the management console of the above-mentioned WSO2 Servers.

### DESCRIPTION
Modifying email templates of identity management notifications such as password recovery, account recovery, etc., is an administrative functionality supported by the WSO2 server's management console. Only users with admin privileges should be allowed to do such operations. It has been found that non-admin users also can modify email templates provided that they can access the management console.

### IMPACT
An attacker having the management console access with a valid non-admin user account can change email templates to mislead users and even perform Eavesdropper attacks to steal information like account recovery confirmations, and a limited set of user account information.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
