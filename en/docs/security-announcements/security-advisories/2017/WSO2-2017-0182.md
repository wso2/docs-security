### OVERVIEW
The Carbon Commons component of the above-listed products has been identified to have potential Arbitrary File Read(AFR) and Arbitrary Directory Read (ADR) vulnerabilities.


### DESCRIPTION
In several versions of the Carbon Commons component, a potential arbitrary file/directory read vulnerability has been discovered. Because of Arbitrary File Read(AFR) vulnerability, it is possible to read arbitrary files starting from the application root folder such as configuration files, binary files, etc. Because of Arbitrary Directory Read(ADR) vulnerability, it is possible to read the directory index of arbitrary directories within the application root folder which includes configuration and library directories.

### IMPACT
As a result of AFR, sensitive data can be read from configuration files present within the carbon server via Remote Code Execution (RCE). In addition to that, the contents of important directories can be scanned via ADR.


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to apply relevant security patches to products which fix the vulnerability in the affected component.
