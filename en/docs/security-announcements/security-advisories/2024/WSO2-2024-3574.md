### OVERVIEW
SOAP admin service allows user signup regardless of self-registration configuration.


### DESCRIPTION
The SOAP admin service in WSO2 products has a security vulnerability that allows the creation of new user accounts regardless of the self-registration configuration settings.

### IMPACT

#### For All Users
If applying the fix or update is not feasible, migrate to the latest unaffected version of the respective WSO2 product(s).

When required the following configuration could be added to the `deployment.toml` file to allow user self-signup. The allowed usernames list should contain the list of system user accounts which are allowed to invoke the UserInformationRecoveryService to initiate relevant API invocations.

```toml
[user_info_recovery_admin_service]
allowed_usernames = [
    "user1",
    "user2"
]
```
If you are using the XML based configuration model, please add the following configuration to the identity.xml file located in `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/`.

```xml
<AdminServices>
        <UserInformationRecoveryService>
            <AllowedUsers>
                <Usernames>user1,user2</Usernames>
            </AllowedUsers>
        </UserInformationRecoveryService>
    </AdminServices>
```

The following section is regarding APIM 2.x versions. If user self-registration is a requirement based on your business use case, you do not need to make any additional changes. 

However, if user self-registration is not a requirement, to mitigate this vulnerability in APIM 2.x versions, even after applying this update, following additional configuration must be applied. This is because APIM 2.x versions utilize relevant SOAP admin services for the user self-signup flow. 

1. Browse to `/_system/governance/apimgt/applicationdata/sign-up-config.xml` via Management Console, open it in edit mode and update below configuration to false to disable self signup in the store portal.
```xml
<EnableSignup>false</EnableSignup>
```
2. Restart the APIM server with the following system property set to `false`.
   
   ```bash
   sh wso2server.sh -DenableUserRegistrationAdminService=false
   ```

It is also important to note that both above configuration options must be applied to completely disable self signup. Configuration change mentioned in item 1 only disables UI components, and item 2 only disables relevant SOAP admin service.
