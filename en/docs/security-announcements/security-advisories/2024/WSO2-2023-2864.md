# SECURITY ADVISORY WSO2-2023-2864

<p class="doc-info">Published: June 25, 2024</p>
<p class="doc-info">Version: 1.0.0</p>

### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 3.2.0, 3.1.0, 3.0.0, 2.6.0
* WSO2 Identity Server 6.1.0, 6.0.0, 5.11.0, 5.10.0, 5.9.0, 5.8.0, 5.7.0
* WSO2 Identity Server as Key Manager 5.10.0, 5.9.0, 5.7.0 


### OVERVIEW
Potential insecure authorization configuration in the OAuth2 flow.


### DESCRIPTION
When the OAuth2 Public Client feature with Client Credentials grant type has been used in a deployment, a malicious actor may obtain the access token without the proper authorization, when the following preconditions are met:

* A service provider must be configured with the `Client Credentials` grant type enabled.
* The “Allow authentication without the client secret" option must be enabled for the above configured service provider. 

### IMPACT
If the preconditions mentioned in the description are met, a malicious actor may obtain an access token for the service provider application without providing client secret. There is no impact to your deployment if all the above mentioned preconditions are not met in your configuration.

### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix:

* [https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-inbound-auth-oauth/pull/2161](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-inbound-auth-oauth/pull/2161)

Along with above PR, we have introduced a property named `PublicClientAllowed` under `SupportedGrantType` configuration which defines the grant types that should be supported for OAuth2 Public Client feature.

Please note that, along with this update, due to security concerns, public client support configuration is disabled by default for custom and "Client Credentials" grant types. If you have an application configured as a public client, the allowed grant types should be configured in the deployment.toml as follows to avoid any negative impacts to your use cases.

For below listed WSO2 products.

* WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 3.2.0, 3.1.0, 3.0.0
* WSO2 Identity Server 6.1.0, 6.0.0, 5.11.0, 5.10.0 

1. Custom grant types
    ```toml
    [[oauth.custom_grant_type]]
    name="customGrant1"
    grant_handler="org.wso2.carbon.identity.oauth2.customGrantHandler"
    grant_validator="org.wso2.carbon.identity.oauth2.customGrantValidator"
    [oauth.custom_grant_type.properties]
    PublicClientAllowed=true
    ```
2. For client credential grant type 
    ```toml
    [oauth.grant_type.client_credentials]
    allow_public_client="true" 
    ```
Additionally, OAuth2 custom grant types can also be configured by adding below configuration in deployment.toml. If you have already used the below given configuration in your deployment, there are no further actions required. However, WSO2 strongly recommends using the above mentioned configurations as a best practice. 

```toml
    [oauth.public_client_support]
    grant_type_names = ["customGrant1"] 
```

For below listed WSO2 products.

* WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0
* WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0, 5.8.0, 5.7.0
* WSO2 Identity Server as Key Manager 5.9.0, 5.7.0 

The PublicClientAllowed property has to be added to the supported grant types defined in the identity.xml file. Except client credentials, All other supported grant types should be configured with PublicClientProvided as “true” and client credentials should be configured as false to mitigate the security vulnerability.

```xml
    <SupportedGrantType>
    <GrantTypeName>customGrant1</GrantTypeName>
    <GrantTypeHandlerImplClass>{path}</GrantTypeHandlerImplClass>
    <PublicClientAllowed>true</PublicClientAllowed>
    </SupportedGrantType> 
```

A configuration to disable client credentials grant type for public clients is mentioned below. 

```xml
    <SupportedGrantType>
    <GrantTypeName>client_credentials</GrantTypeName>
    <GrantTypeHandlerImplClass>[path]</GrantTypeHandlerImplClass>
    <IsRefreshTokenAllowed>false</IsRefreshTokenAllowed>
    <IdTokenAllowed>false</IdTokenAllowed>
    <PublicClientAllowed>true</PublicClientAllowed>
    </SupportedGrantType> 
```

### Note
If you are currently utilizing a custom grant type for public clients in your deployment, please apply the provided configuration changes after receiving the update. This ensures the preservation of the existing functionality of the deployment and prevents any potential functional failures.
