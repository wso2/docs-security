### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.3.0, 4.2.0
* WSO2 Identity Server: 6.1.0, 6.0.0



### OVERVIEW
A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the authentication endpoint.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to lack of output encoding, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out against the authentication endpoint by injecting a malicious payload from a malicious actor.

### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.

### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix:
