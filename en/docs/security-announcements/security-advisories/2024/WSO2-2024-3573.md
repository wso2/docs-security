### OVERVIEW
Potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities via SOAP admin service.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to a business logic error, a malicious actor can potentially create a new user with elevated permissions if the following conditions are met:

* SOAP admin services are accessible to the malicious actor.
* The deployment includes an attribute used for internal purposes, which is not included by default in WSO2 products.
* The deployment includes at least one custom role which has a permission that is not included by default in WSO2 Products.
* The malicious actor has knowledge of the custom role, and the attribute created in the deployment.

### IMPACT
By exploiting this vulnerability, malicious actors may obtain higher privileges for self-registered users when prerequisites mentioned in the description section are met.

### SOLUTION

#### Community Users (Open Source)
We highly recommend to migrate to the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.


#### Commercial Users
Update your product to the specified update level—or a higher update level—to apply the fix.
