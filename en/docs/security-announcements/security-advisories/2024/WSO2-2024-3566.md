### OVERVIEW
Authenticated arbitrary file upload via SOAP admin service.


### DESCRIPTION

By leveraging the arbitrary file upload vulnerability, it is further possible to gain remote code execution on the server. However, malicious actors require admin privileges to exploit this vulnerability

### IMPACT
