### OVERVIEW
A potential stored Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Management Console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to lack of input validation, a stored XSS attack could be performed through the Rich text editor page in the management console's registry section.

### IMPACT
In order to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious actor should have a valid user account which has administrative access to the Management Console and should be able to reach it. If such access could be obtained, a malicious actor could steal user data and perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.

### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix:
