!!! info warning
    Please note that this announcement includes only the product versions affected as per our [backporting policy](https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-processes/vulnerability-management-process/#backport-policy).


### OVERVIEW
Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to lack of validation, user supplies data directly pass into the server response of a vulnerable services endpoint, without any sanitization or encoding.

### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible. However, if the service endpoint is not permitted at the gateway level, the impact would be further reduced.
