### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server : 5.11.0, 5.10.0


### OVERVIEW
Open redirection vulnerability in account recovery endpoint when invalid or expired code is
submitted.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the improper implementation, the callback URL is not validated against the defined callback regex.Therefore, it may lead to open redirection vulnerability when invalid or expired code is submitted.


### IMPACT
By using social engineering techniques, an attacker could persuade a user to click on a link with malicious payload and get the user redirected to an attacker controlled page where a phishing attack could be executed to obtain highly sensitive information or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
We highly recommend to migrate the latest version of respective WSO2 products to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
