### OVERVIEW
A partial authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in the application authentication flow.


### DESCRIPTION
When there are multiple steps configured for an application authentication flow, the current state of the authentication chain is maintained by a single value that gets passed as a parameter in the URLs of the redirects. If a malicious user is aware of this value, there is a low possibility of partially bypassing the authentication chain, given the malicious actor could obtain a response generated as a result of an earlier successful authentication step using person in the middle technique or other similar means.

### IMPACT
If an attacker is able to obtain the state maintenance parameter value at some point in the application authentication chain, it is possible to bypass the already authenticated steps by the legitimate user and attempt the remaining steps in the chain.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix:
