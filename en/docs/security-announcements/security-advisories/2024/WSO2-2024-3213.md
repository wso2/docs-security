!!! info warning
    Please note that this announcement includes only the product versions affected as per our [backporting policy](https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-processes/vulnerability-management-process/#backport-policy).


### OVERVIEW
APIs can be accessed without the session cookies in the certain condition.


### DESCRIPTION
Given the malicious actor has access to a valid refresh token of an admin user, due to the improper authorization check and token mapping, application’s protected APIs can be accessed without the session cookie.

### IMPACT
This behavior could potentially allow a malicious actor to access the API resource if they obtain the refresh token of the admin through any means, especially considering that refresh tokens typically have a longer expiration time compared to access tokens.


### SOLUTION

#### Commercial Users
Update your product to the specified update level—or a higher update level—to apply the fix.
