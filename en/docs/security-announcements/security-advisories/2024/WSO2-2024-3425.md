### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Identity Server : 7.0.0


### OVERVIEW
A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the sub organization login flow


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the lack of input validation, malicious actors may perform the Cross Site Scripting vulnerability against sub organization login flow if the sub organization concept has been used.

### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, a malicious actor can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar attacks would not be possible.
