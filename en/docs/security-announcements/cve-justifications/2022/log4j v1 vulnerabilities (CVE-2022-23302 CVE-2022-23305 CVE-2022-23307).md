### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
* CVE-2022-23302[^1]: `JMSSink` in log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data.
* CVE-2022-23305[^2]: `JDBCAppender` in log4j 1.2.x is vulnerable to SQL Injection flow.
* CVE-2022-23307[^3]: *Chainsaw GUI* feature in log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data.

!!! info todo
    This issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, JDBCAppender or Chainsaw which is not the default.


### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
Exploitation of CVE-2022-23302[^1], CVE-2022-23305[^2] and CVE-2022-23307[^3] require the ability to modify Log4j configuration files (*log4j.xml/ log4j.properties*) and restart the WSO2 product as these features have not been enabled in WSO2 products by default. This requires access to the file system of the server with write permissions to relevant product configuration files. Therefore, it is unlikely that an external attacker could perform CVE-2022-23302[^1], CVE-2022-23305[^2] or CVE-2022-23307[^3] exploitation.

We will update this announcement if further actions are required.
