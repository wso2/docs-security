### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

Pivotal Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required. 

NOTE: the vendor's position is that untrusted data is not an intended use case. The product's behavior will not be changed because some users rely on deserialization of trusted data.

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

This vulnerability is exploitable only if HTTP invoker endpoints are exposed to untrusted clients. A review of the product codebase confirmed that the classes HTTPInvokerServiceExporter and RemoteInvocationSerializingExporter are not used, so the product is not affected.

The vulnerability exists in all Spring dependencies, and no official fix has been released yet [1]. The recommended remediation is to avoid exposing HTTP invoker endpoints to untrusted clients [1][2].

As a best practice, we generally upgrade third-party dependencies to the latest non-vulnerable versions. However, updating the Spring dependency in the current versions would require significant developer effort, as the recommended fixed version is only supported on Java 17. Since WSO2 Identity Server supports Java 17 only from version 6.1.0 onwards, we will not be updating the Spring dependency in Identity Server 5.10.0.

Since the Spring framework has been completely removed in later releases, we recommend upgrading to WSO2 Identity Server 6.1.0 or above.
