### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- N/A

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

The reported vulnerability relates specifically to the `wso2id-oauth-plugin`, which is a third-party plugin developed independently by an external party. WSO2 has no involvement in the development, maintenance, or support of this plugin.

Importantly, **WSO2 does not include or rely on this plugin in any of its products**, including the WSO2 Identity Server or any associated WSO2 extensions. As such, the reported issue has no impact or relevance to any WSO2-distributed software.

Additionally, it should be noted that the `wso2id-oauth-plugin` has already been **suspended** by the Jenkins plugin maintainers due to security concerns[^3].
