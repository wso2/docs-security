# CVE-2025-41249

<p class="doc-info">WSO2 Products impacted: no</p>
<p class="doc-info">Customers actions required: no</p>
---

### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A vulnerability was identified in Spring Security's `@EnableMethodSecurity` annotation, which could allow unauthorized access under specific configurations where method-level security is improperly enforced.

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0, 5.11.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

Although the vulnerable dependency `org.springframework:spring-core` is packaged with WSO2 products, it does not introduce any security impact because the `@EnableMethodSecurity` annotation is required to trigger the vulnerability which is not used in the relevant WSO2 product codebases.
Therefore, the vulnerability is **not exploitable** within WSO2 IS.
