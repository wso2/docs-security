### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A vulnerability was identified in Spring Security's `@EnableMethodSecurity` annotation, which could allow unauthorized access under specific configurations where method-level security is improperly enforced.

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0, 5.11.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

Although the vulnerable dependency `org.springframework:spring-core` is bundled with WSO2 products, it does not introduce any security risk. The vulnerability can only be exploited when the `@EnableMethodSecurity` annotation is used, which is not present in the relevant WSO2 product codebases.
Therefore, this vulnerability is **not exploitable** in the aforementioned WSO2 products.
