### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A vulnerability was identified in Spring Security's `@EnableMethodSecurity` annotation, which could allow unauthorized access under specific configurations where method-level security is improperly enforced.

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0, 5.11.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

Although WSO2 Identity Server(IS) versions 5.10.0 and 5.11.0 include dependency `org.springframework:spring-core` that can expose the affected Spring Security component, the `@EnableMethodSecurity` annotation is **not used in any WSO2 IS code**.  
Therefore, the vulnerability is **not exploitable** within WSO2 IS.
