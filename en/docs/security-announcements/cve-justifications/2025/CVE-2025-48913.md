# CVE-2025-48913

### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A vulnerability was reported in Apache CXF affecting the Java Message Service (JMS) transport classes. Exploiting this vulnerability may allow attackers to trigger unintended behavior in systems that rely on JMS as a supported transport mechanism [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.0, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

WSO2 API Manager (APIM) and WSO2 Identity Server (IS) do **not** make use of the Apache CXF component `org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-transports-jms`, which is the only module affected by this vulnerability [^2][^3]. Therefore, the **vulnerable code path is not present** or exercised in the APIM or IS runtime.

Some vulnerability scanners may incorrectly flag this issue due to the inclusion of other CXF components such as `org.apache.cxf:cxf-core`. However, the `cxf-core` library does **not** include the `org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-transports-jms` component, which contains the vulnerable classes, and therefore is **not affected** by this vulnerability. According to the Snyk advisories, [^3] confirms that the vulnerability affects `org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-transports-jms`, whereas [^4] clearly states that `org.apache.cxf:cxf-core` is **not** impacted. This further validates that the reported CVE does **not** apply to WSO2 API Manager. These detections are **false positives** resulting from indirect references to CXF dependencies.

The vulnerability is addressed in **Apache CXF 3.6.8 and above**, which requires **JDK 11**. This fix is applicable to APIM versions **3.2.1, 4.2.0, and newer versions**, and IS version **6.0.0 and newer versions**, as these are based solely on JDK 11 and above. Applying this fix to APIM 4.1.0 and earlier versions, and IS 5.11.0 and earlier versions, is **not feasible**, since those versions support both JDK 8 and JDK 11. Using CXF 3.6.8 in such environments would cause server startup failures under JDK 8 due to the new JDK baseline requirement.

### CONCLUSION

- **APIM 4.1.0 and earlier**: Not affected. Upgrade is not feasible as the fix is incompatible with JDK 8. No action required.
- **APIM 3.2.1, 4.2.0, and newer**: Will be upgraded to Apache CXF 3.6.8.
- **IS 5.11.0 and earlier**: Not affected. Upgrade is not feasible as the fix is incompatible with JDK 8. No action required.
- **IS 6.0.0 and newer**: Will be upgraded to Apache CXF 3.6.8.
