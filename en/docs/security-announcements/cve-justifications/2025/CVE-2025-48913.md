# CVE-2025-48913

### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A vulnerability was reported in Apache CXF affecting the Java Message Service (JMS) transport classes. Exploiting this vulnerability may allow attackers to trigger unintended behavior in systems that rely on JMS as a supported transport mechanism [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.0, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0
- WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10.0, 5.11.0, 6.0.0, 6.1.0, 7.0.0, 7.1.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

The reported prodcuts do **not** make use of the Apache CXF component `org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-transports-jms`, which is the only module affected by this vulnerability [^2][^3]. Therefore, the **vulnerable code path is not present** or exercised in the APIM or IS runtime.

Some vulnerability scanners may incorrectly flag this issue due to the inclusion of other CXF components such as `org.apache.cxf:cxf-core`. However, the `cxf-core` library does **not** include the `org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-transports-jms` component, which contains the vulnerable classes, and therefore is **not affected** by this vulnerability. According to the Snyk advisories, [^3] confirms that the vulnerability affects `org.apache.cxf:cxf-rt-transports-jms`, whereas [^4] clearly states that `org.apache.cxf:cxf-core` is **not** impacted. This further validates that the reported CVE does **not** apply to WSO2 API Manager. These detections are **false positives** resulting from indirect references to CXF dependencies.

### CONCLUSION

- **APIM 4.1.0 and earlier**, **IS 5.11.0 and earlier**: Not affected. `org.apache.cxf:cxf-core` upgrade is not feasible as the fix is incompatible with JDK 8. No action required.
- **APIM 3.2.1, 4.2.0, and newer**, **IS 6.0.0 and newer**: Not affected. `org.apache.cxf:cxf-core` will be upgraded to Apache CXF 3.6.8.
