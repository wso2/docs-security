# CVE-2025-48913

### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A vulnerability was reported in Apache CXF affecting the Java Message Service (JMS) transport classes. Exploiting this vulnerability may allow attackers to trigger unintended behavior in systems that rely on JMS as a supported transport mechanism [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.0, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

WSO2 API Manager (APIM) does not make use of Apache CXFâ€™s JMS transport classes. As a result, the vulnerable code path in Apache CXF is **never exercised** within the APIM runtime. Therefore, none of the APIM versions listed above are affected by this vulnerability.

The vulnerability is addressed in **Apache CXF 3.6.8 and above**, which requires **JDK 11**. This fix is applicable to APIM versions **3.2.1, 4.2.0, and newer versions**, as these are based solely on JDK 11 and above. Applying this fix to APIM 4.1.0 and earlier versions is **not feasible**, since those versions support both JDK 8 and JDK 11. Using CXF 3.6.8 in such environments would cause server startup failures under JDK 8 due to the new JDK baseline requirement.

### CONCLUSION

- **APIM 4.1.0 and earlier**: Not affected. Upgrade is not feasible as the fix is incompatible with JDK 8. No action required.
- **APIM 3.2.1, 4.2.0, and newer**: Will be upgraded to Apache CXF 3.6.8.
