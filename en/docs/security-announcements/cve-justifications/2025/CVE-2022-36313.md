# CVE-2022-36313

<p class="doc-info">WSO2 Products Impacted: No</p>
<p class="doc-info">Customers Actions Required: No</p>
---

### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

An issue was discovered in the file-type package before 16.5.4 and 17.x before 17.1.3 for Node.js. A malformed MKV file could cause the file type detector to get caught in an infinite loop. This would make the application become unresponsive and could be used to cause a DoS attack. [^1][^2]

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager 3.2.0 and higher

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

The `file-type` package appears in WSO2 API Manager only as a transitive dependency introduced via Stoplight Elements (through the `postman-collection` dependency used by Stoplight components). We reviewed the product dependency tree and identified the `file-type` version packaged with API Manager as `file-type@3.9.0`.

According to the referenced advisories and the linked discussion on the upstream project [^3][^4], the specific vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36313 applies to particular `file-type` release branches and is not present in the code used in the API Manager build (as indicated by the referenced Postman project comment). Therefore, WSO2 products are not impacted and no customer action is required at this time.

### CONCLUSION

- The `file-type` version bundled with WSO2 API Manager (`file-type@3.9.0`) does not contain the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36313.
- WSO2 products are not impacted; no customer action is required.
