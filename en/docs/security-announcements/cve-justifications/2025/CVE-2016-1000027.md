# CVE-2016-1000027

<p class="doc-info">WSO2 Products Impacted: No</p>

### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
Pivotal Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 3.1.0, 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.0
* WSO2 Identity Server : 5.10, 5.11, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0
* WSO2 Identity Server as Key Manager : 5.10
* WSO2 Enterprise Integrator : 6.6.0


### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
According to CVE considerations, the root cause lies in the `readRemoteInvocation` method within the `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` class, which is part of the Spring HTTP Invoker in Spring Web. This method does not sufficiently restrict or verify untrusted objects prior to deserializing them [^2].

This class, along with others related to Spring HTTP Invoker, has been removed by the Spring team starting from Spring 6.x. However, the above-listed WSO2 products use Spring versions 5.3.31 through 5.3.39 and cannot be upgraded to Spring 6.x due to its dependency on Tomcat 10+, making such an upgrade unfeasible.

To address this vulnerability, WSO2 has forked Spring versions 5.3.31 through 5.3.39 from the original Spring repository [^3] and removed all the vulnerable classes through targeted efforts such as [^4], as these classes are not used in any WSO2 product use cases. Hence, in Spring versions 5.3.31-wso2v1 and onwards, which are bundled with the above-listed products, the reported vulnerability is not present.

### CONCLUSION
- WSO2 uses a fork of Spring [^3] in which all vulnerable classes have been removed.

Therefore, WSO2 concludes that **this is not a vulnerability present in aforementioned WSO2 products**, and **a dependency upgrade will not be carried out solely based on the detection of CVE-2016-1000027**.
