### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
There are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns. [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Micro Integrator : 4.4.0, 4.3.0, 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 1.2.0, 1.1.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
According to the CVE description, the Apache Commons Configuration team does not intend to fix the vulnerability in the 1.x series. Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenarios where you only load trusted configurations [^1]. 

In the context of WSO2, Apache Commons Configuration is utilized solely for loading the `log4j2.properties` file, which is a trusted configuration file. While the vulnerability has been resolved in the 2.x series, upgrading to this version would necessitate significant refactoring of WSO2's existing codebase, which is not feasible at this time.

To mitigate this vulnerability, WSO2 plans to either upgrade to Apache Commons Configuration 2.x or adopt a suitable alternative in a forthcoming release.

### CONCLUSION
- WSO2 uses Commons Configuration to load the log4j2.properties file only. Since it's still safe to use Commons Configuration 1.x to load trusted configurations and Commons Configuration 2.x is not a drop-in replacement **a dependency upgrade will not be carried out solely based on the detection of CVE-2025-46392**.
