### CONCLUSION

Based on the following key points:

- The omission of commercial patch versions in external advisories.
- The correct identification of affected and fixed versions has not been provided in the original CVE publication[^1[^2]].
- A fix has already been included as per WSO2-2021-1289 [^3].

Therefore, WSO2 concludes that **this is a false positive**, and **not an exploitable vulnerability** in WSO2 products when using the fixed or later versions.
