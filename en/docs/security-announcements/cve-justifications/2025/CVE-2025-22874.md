### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
A flaw was found in Go's `crypto/x509` package. This vulnerability allows improper certificate validation, bypassing policy constraints via abusing `ExtKeyUsageAny` in `VerifyOptions.KeyUsages` [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 Choreo Connect : 1.2.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
According to CVE considerations, the root cause lies in the `Verify` [^2] method within the `crypto/x509` package, which is part of the standard Go library. When calling the Verify function with a `VerifyOptions.KeyUsages` that contains `ExtKeyUsageAny`, policy validation is unintentionally disabled [^3].

The vulnerability affects the aforementioned package in Go versions prior to 1.24.4. The v0.4.38 version of `grpc-health-probe` binary packaged in Choreo Connect, which is the latest available release of the tool at this time, is built with Go 1.24.2. Although the Go version has been updated to 1.24.4 in the master branch of the `grpc-health-probe` repository [^4], a new release containing the fixed `crypto/x509` has not yet been published. As a result, it is currently not possible to incorporate a patched version of `grpc-health-probe` into the product.

Furthermore, it should be noted that this vulnerability is only triggered in certificate chains that include policy graphs [^5], which are not present in the `grpc-health-probe` codebase. The only methods utilized by `grpc-health-probe` are the `NewCertPool`[^6] method and `AppendCertsFromPEM`[^7]. Hence, in `grpc-health-probe` version 0.4.38, which is bundled with the above-listed product, the reported vulnerability is not present.

### CONCLUSION
- The `grpc-health-probe` used in the WSO2 product **does not contain** the above mentioned vulnerability.
- There is no current version of `grpc-health-probe` that has the vulnerability mitigated.
- When such a version is released, the mentioned dependency will be upgraded.
