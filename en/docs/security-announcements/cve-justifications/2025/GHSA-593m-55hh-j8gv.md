### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A vulnerability has been identified in **@sentry/browser** where versions prior to **7.119.1** may act as a *prototype pollution gadget*. This means that while the package itself is **not directly exploitable**, it could be abused by an attacker if another prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the application.  

**Affected component:** `@sentry/browser`  
**Installed version:** 6.19.7  
**Required version:** 7.119.1  

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0 and earlier

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

The affected dependency **@sentry/browser@6.19.7** is included in the **Developer Portal application** as a **transitive dependency**, introduced via Stoplight Elements.

- The package does not introduce a direct security vulnerability on its own.  
- It may only pose a risk if a prototype pollution vulnerability exists elsewhere in the application.  
- WSO2 APIM does not expose such vulnerabilities in its context, so the dependency does not present an exploitable threat.  

Nevertheless, keeping dependencies updated is important for long-term security, performance, and compatibility. WSO2 will address this by upgrading **@sentry/browser** to **7.119.1** in a future update. Additionally, **@sentry/react** will be upgraded to a compatible 7.x version to maintain alignment.

### CUSTOMER ACTIONS REQUIRED

- No immediate manual action is required from customers.  
- This issue will be resolved in an upcoming update release.
