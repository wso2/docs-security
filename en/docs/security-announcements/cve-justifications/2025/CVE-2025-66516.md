### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

CVE-2025-66516 [^1][^2] identifies a vulnerability in the `tika-core` dependency that allows an attacker to carry out XML External Entity injection via a crafted XFA file inside a PDF.  The entrypoint for the exploitation is through the `tika-parser-pdf-module` (*for 2.x versions*) or `tika-parsers` (*for 1.x versions*). This CVE covers the same vulnerability as in CVE-2025-54988 [^3][^4] which was reported against the `tika-parser-pdf-module`. CVE-2025-66516 redefines an expanded scope for the same CVE-2025-54988 vulnerability due to below reasons.

- Although only the `tika-parser-pdf-module` was mentioned as affected by CVE-2025-54988 the vulnerability and the fix for it are in `tika-core` component[^5]. Hence the users who only upgraded  `tika-parser-pdf-module` to mitigate CVE-2025-54988 are still vulnerable.
- In tika 1.x series the `PDFParsers` classes are in the `tika-parsers` module and the original CVE-2025-54988 had no mention of it.

In summary, CVE-2025-66516 is the same vulnerability as CVE-2025-54988 but with a revised scope for affected modules including `tika-core` (1.13-3.2.1), `tika-parsers` (1.13-1.28.5) and `tika-pdf-parser-module` (2.0.0-3.2.1).

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.0, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0, 4.6.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

WSO2 API Manager **uses** `tika-core` component in publisher REST APIs to **detect the MIME types of uploaded thumbnail and document files**. Furthermore there is no usage of `tika-parser-pdf-module` nor `tika-parsers` in API Manager. Tika MIME type detection is not affected by the vulnerability and this has been confirmed by a Tika committer [^6]. Hence API Manager Product is not affected by CVE-2025-66516.

### CONCLUSION

- WSO2 API Manager is not affected by the vulnerability CVE-2025-66516.
