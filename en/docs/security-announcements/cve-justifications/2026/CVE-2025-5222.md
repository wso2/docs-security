### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A stack buffer overflow was found in International components for unicode (ICU). While running the `genrb` binary, the 'subtag' struct overflowed at the `SRBRoot::addTag` function. This issue may lead to memory corruption and local arbitrary code execution.; fixed in 78.1. [^1]

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 Identity Server: 7.2.0, 7.1.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

CVE-2025-5222 affects the native ICU (C/C++) tooling, specifically the genrb utility, due to unsafe memory handling that can result in a stack buffer overflow.

WSO2 Identity Server includes icu4j which is the pure Java implementation of ICU. ICU4J does not include or depend on the native ICU C/C++ libraries, nor does it bundle or execute the genrb binary or any other native tooling at runtime. Since ICU4J is fully Java-based and executes entirely within the JVM, while the affected code paths exist only in native ICU tooling written in C/C++, and no native ICU binaries (.so, .dll, .dylib) or build-time tools are shipped or invoked, the conditions required to exploit this vulnerability are not present in our product.

Additionally, although the aforementioned vulnerability has been fixed in the ICU4J 78.x series, according to the Graal SDK team [^2], the compatible ICU4J version for graal-sdk-22.3.4 is ICU4J 71.1. As such, upgrading ICU4J independently within the same Graal SDK version is not supported or compatible.

Addressing this vulnerability would require a major Graal SDK version upgrade, rather than a standalone ICU4J update. Considering that this vulnerability is not exploitable in our product context, as it affects native ICU tooling which is not present or executed, we do not plan to perform an immediate Graal SDK upgrade at this time.
