# CVE-2026-21884

<p class="doc-info">WSO2 Products Impacted: no</p>

### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A XSS vulnerability exists in React Router's "<ScrollRestoration>" API in Framework Mode when using the "getKey/storageKey" props during Server-Side Rendering which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution during SSR if untrusted content is used to generate the keys. Note: This does not impact applications if developers have disabled server-side rendering in Framework Mode, or if they are using Declarative Mode (<BrowserRouter>) or Data Mode (createBrowserRouter/<RouterProvider>)[^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.0, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0, 4.6.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

- WSO2 API Manager portals (Publisher, DevPortal, and Admin) are implemented as **client-side rendered applications** and do not use Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Therefore, the affected <ScrollRestoration> API and its associated `getKey` / `storageKey` behavior are not applicable, and the vulnerability cannot be triggered in API Manager portals.

### CONCLUSION
- Given that WSO2 API Manager portals operate using **client-side rendering** and the reported XSS vulnerability cannot be exploited. Therefore, **CVE-2026-21884 does not apply** to WSO2 API Manager.
