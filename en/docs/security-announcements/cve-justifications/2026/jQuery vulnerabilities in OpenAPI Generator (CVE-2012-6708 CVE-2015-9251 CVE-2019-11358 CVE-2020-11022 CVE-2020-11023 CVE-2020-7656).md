### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
* CVE-2012-6708[^1]: jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion.
* CVE-2015-9251[^2]: jQuery before 3.0.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks when a cross-domain Ajax request is performed without the dataType option, causing text/javascript responses to be executed.
* CVE-2019-11358[^3]: jQuery before 3.4.0 mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable __proto__ property, it could extend the native Object.prototype.
* CVE-2020-11022[^4]: In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources, even after sanitizing it to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.
* CVE-2020-11023[^5]: In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.0.3 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML containing `<option>` elements from untrusted sources, even after sanitizing it to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.
* CVE-2020-7656[^6]: jQuery prior to 1.9.0 allows Cross-site Scripting attacks via the load method. The load method fails to recognize and remove `<script>` HTML tags that contain a whitespace character.


### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.5.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
jQuery is used only by the frontend UI assets bundled with OpenAPI Generator (specifically for Swagger UI–based HTML documentation). WSO2 API Manager (API-M) does not use this UI layer and relies solely on the Java-based OpenAPI Generator functionality for client SDK generation in Developer Portal. API-M's runtime execution environment operates entirely within Java/Servlet container context without JavaScript interpretation, DOM parsing, event handling, or browser execution semantics. Therefore, the presence of jQuery vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-6708[^1], CVE-2015-9251[^2], CVE-2019-11358[^3], CVE-2020-11022[^4], CVE-2020-11023[^5], and CVE-2020-7656[^6]) is not applicable to the API-M implementation and does not pose a security concern for its runtime behavior.
