### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
* CVE-2012-6708[^1]: jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion.
* CVE-2015-9251[^2]: jQuery before 3.0.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks when a cross-domain Ajax request is performed without the dataType option, causing text/javascript responses to be executed.
* CVE-2019-11358[^3]: jQuery before 3.4.0 mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable __proto__ property, it could extend the native Object.prototype.
* CVE-2020-11022[^4]: In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources, even after sanitizing it to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.
* CVE-2020-11023[^5]: In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.0.3 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML containing `<option>` elements from untrusted sources, even after sanitizing it to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.
* CVE-2020-7656[^6]: jQuery prior to 1.9.0 allows Cross-site Scripting attacks via the load method. The load method fails to recognize and remove `<script>` HTML tags that contain a whitespace character.


### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.5.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
jQuery is included only in Swagger UI–related static frontend assets bundled with OpenAPI Generator. These assets are not used, served, or executed by WSO2 API Manager at runtime.
API-M uses OpenAPI Generator only for Java-based backend processing (e.g., client SDK generation) and does not execute any JavaScript code. Therefore, the reported jQuery vulnerabilities are not reachable or exploitable in the API-M runtime and do not pose a security risk.
