# WSO2 Public Cloud

The WSO2 public cloud includes the following elements:

## Asgardeo
Asgardeo provides a SaaS-based identity and access management (IAM) solution for managing user identities.

## Choreo
Choreo is a SaaS application development suite designed to accelerate the creation of digital experiences. Companies can build, deploy, monitor, and manage cloud-native applications to increase developer productivity and focus on innovation.

## Choreo Control Plane (CP)
Organizations can use the Choreo control plane components to define, create, observe, and manage APIs, integrations, applications, and cloud-native workloads. These workloads can be deployed to the cloud data plane or private data plane.

## Choreo Data Planes (DP)
The workloads of Choreo subscribers are deployed on data planes.

## Choreo Cloud Data Plane (CDP)
The Choreo cloud data plane is the default data plane for Choreo. It is available in the US and EU regions and fully managed by WSO2.

## Choreo Private Data Plane (PDP)
Choreo subscribers can deploy their workloads on a private data plane, which provides enhanced isolation and control over subscriber workloads. WSO2 can manage private data planes on either WSO2-owned or subscriber-owned Cloud Service Provider subscriptions such as Azure, AWS, GCP, Vultr, etc. Subscribers can choose between Standard and Premium PDP configurations, each providing different levels of security and management models tailored to meet isolation and security requirements. For more details, please refer to the PDP Security section.

## WSO2 Billing and Subscription Portal
The billing and subscription portal allows cloud subscribers to choose their preferred subscription options and view their usage.

## Payment gateway (Stripe)
WSO2 public clouds utilize Stripe, a PCI-DSS-certified payment gateway provider. Subscribers enter their payment and billing information directly on Stripe when they are subscribing to paid plans.

## Support Portal (ServiceNow)
WSO2 subscribers can raise support tickets through ServiceNow, our ticketing system.

## Data Protection

**Data subject** is someone who can be identified from personal data. The data subject's rights will be addressed in the relevant data protection laws and regulations, such as the right to be deleted, informed, data portability, and object data processing, and not to be subject to profiling and automated decision-making.

**Data controller** is the legal entity or person that decides the purposes and means of processing personal data. The Data controller must comply with respective data protection laws and regulations and comply with data subject requests.

**Data processor** is the legal entity or the person who processes personal data on behalf of the controller. The Data processor must comply with respective data protection laws and regulations and comply with data subject requests.

## WSO2's Role in Protecting Data

WSO2 has a dual responsibility as a Data controller and Data processor, depending on the purpose for which the personal data is consumed.

**As the Data controller**, WSO2 will collect personal data from the users interacting with WSO2 public cloud platforms, which are limited to:
* Collecting data to perform legal compliance screening requirements.
* Collecting data required for user registration or signup process.
* Collecting data required for billing and subscription purposes.
* Collecting data to protect the platform from security threats.
* Collecting data to improve our services.

**As the Data processor**, WSO2 will process data provided to WSO2 by the subscriber (who shall be the Data controller). For example, the subscriber is the Data controller for users they invite to WSO2 public clouds, and data is uploaded to WSO2 public clouds by the subscriber and its users.

WSO2 is the data controller for the "Organization Administrator profiles and associated data." This is because WSO2 decides what data is needed for the creation of cloud user profiles to facilitate the service for the subscriber.

The subscriber is the data controller for the "End user profiles and associated data." WSO2 is the data processor, as WSO2 processes the data shared according to the subscriber's instructions.

In an event where a partner is developing a subscriber's business use cases using WSO2 clouds and has access to personally identifiable information (PII) while managing the implementation. In that case, the partner also becomes the data processor as they may have access to PIIs and could define the application behaviors. WSO2 becomes a sub-processor in this instance.

Both the data controller and the data processor need to have a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) in place. The DPA should include provisions for passing on DPA obligations to any subprocessors used by the data processor. Additionally, the data processor and any subprocessors should also have a DPA between them.

**As a Data processor, WSO2 will be responsible for:**
* Processing personal data in accordance with the Data controllerÂ´s instructions.
* Safeguarding and protecting the Data controller's data in accordance with all required technical and organizational measures and data protection laws currently in force.
* Ensuring Data subject requests (DSRs) are addressed.
* Providing information and all reasonable assistance related to data privacy and security requests from the Data controller.
* Ensuring that sub-processors adhere to all data protection requirements and standards.
* Ensuring that WSO2 has adopted appropriate safeguards and adequate levels of protection for cross-border data transfers.
* Notifying the Data controller if WSO2:
  * receives requests from the subscriber's administrators and developers exercising their GDPR rights.
  * receives requests from any supervisory authorities (unless prohibited by law).
  * receives requests from any law enforcement authorities.
  * becomes aware of a confirmed security breach.
  * changes to privacy policies, terms, security statements, data protection agreements, processors, or sub-processors.

## Subscriber's Role in Protecting Data

**The subscriber, as the Data controller, will be responsible for:**
* Complying with relevant data protection laws and regulations as applicable to the subscriber.
* As between WSO2 and the subscriber, the subscriber will always remain in control of the data added by the subscriber or its users to the platform.
* Ensure subscribers' integrations with third-party applications are secure and in accordance with data protection requirements.
* Adhering to relevant security best practices as per WSO2 product documentation.
* Inform WSO2 of any data subject requests from subscribers' administrators and developers so that WSO2 can support the subscriber in processing the request. The subscribers can submit a request [form](#) or contact the data protection officer at dpo@wso2.com.
* Informing WSO2 of any vulnerabilities or security issues related to the platform.
* Complying with WSO2 public cloud Terms of Use.

## Data Residency

### Where is the subscriber data stored?
* **Asgardeo**
  * Asgardeo organization administrator profiles and associated data would be stored in Asgardeo US deployment.
  * Asgardeo end user profiles and associated data would be stored in the region where the deployment is provisioned (US or EU).
* **Choreo**
  * Choreo uses Asgardeo as its default identity provider.
    * Hence, both user profiles and associated data would be stored in Asgardeo US deployment.
  * If a subscriber wants to use their existing external IDP, the administrator and end-user profiles and associated data will remain within that IDP.
  * Choreo's control plane stores specific component data in US deployment.
  * Choreo applications and associated data would reside in the region where the data plane would reside.
    * Choreo cloud data plane - US - Azure
    * Choreo cloud data plane - EU - Azure
    * Choreo private data plane - subscriber's preferred data center region (AWS, Azure, GCP, OnPrem)
* WSO2 public cloud's billing and support portals are hosted in the US.

### Can subscribers govern where their data is hosted?
* **Asgardeo**
  * Asgardeo subscribers can select US or EU data centers to store user data while provisioning the Asgardeo organization. However, the Asgardeo organization administrator profile data would be residing in the Asgardeo US deployment. For more details, please refer to "Data residency in Asgardeo."
* **Choreo**
  * Choreo subscribers can host their workloads on the Choreo cloud data plane (US and EU) or private data planes in a region and a cloud or a data center of their preference. However, Choreo control plane data would reside in the US.
  * Choreo also simplifies creating databases, caches, and message brokers for user applications on GCP, AWS, Azure, and DigitalOcean, with deployment options in the US, EU, and Australia if they prefer to use application dependencies created through Choreo instead of connecting to their existing resources.

### Is subscriber data transferred around the world?
WSO2 would not transfer data outside of the region where the data is residing. The WSO2 team would have limited access to deployment data; please refer to the Data Access section.

### What is the legal basis for WSO2 cross-border data transfers?
WSO2 operates globally and may transfer, store, access, or process subscribers' data across its affiliates and authorized subprocessors to provide the purchased services.

For transfers of personal data originating from the EU, WSO2 relies on valid legal mechanisms, including adequacy decisions or the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (2021). WSO2 ensures that all cross-border data transfers from the EU comply with GDPR requirements.

WSO2 employees across WSO2 subsidiaries and affiliate companies access personal data collected by WSO2 solely to provide subscription and professional services for the subscriber. This includes ancillary operational activities related to subscription and professional services, such as account management and invoicing. Additionally, data collected from visitors to the WSO2 websites are accessed for website-related functionalities and services.

This data will be accessed exclusively by WSO2 employees and the authorized subprocessors involved in the activities mentioned above.

## Data Access

### Who has access to subscriber data?
* The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team would have access to the public cloud deployments to perform maintenance, administration, troubleshooting, and support. Only the SRE team is granted access to the deployments and their data. Other teams would need to go through service requests and change requests to gain deployment-related data access if required.
* The Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) team, which would interact with subscribers to support queries and issues, would have access to subscriber information on our support ticketing system and log data.
* The security team would have access to log data to monitor and respond to security events and incidents.
* WSO2 account managers would have access to the support ticketing system and CRM for account management.

### How do WSO2 employees access the cloud infrastructure?
WSO2 uses Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to control access to Azure resources. SRE team members must activate their eligible roles and submit requests for access. The team consists of specialized sub-teams, like Asgardeo-SRE and Choreo-SRE, ensuring no shared access across deployments. WSO2 also employs VPN connections with one-time passwords (OTPs) and uses Bastion instances for administrative tasks.

### From what locations do you access data?
Following are the locations where our teams are residing:
* SRE - Sri Lanka, India, Brazil.
* CRE - Sri Lanka, India, Australia, Brazil, Spain, UK, USA.
* Security - Sri Lanka.
* Account Management - Sri Lanka, USA, UK, Germany, Spain, Australia, India, Brazil, Dubai, and Singapore.

## Technical and Organizational Controls

### Cloud Security
Please refer to our [cloud security process](#) for detailed information on incorporating security into public clouds.

### PDP Security
We offer Standard and Premium Private Data Planes (PDPs), each designed with varying levels of security to balance cost and protection. If you are interested in using a PDP, please ensure you select the appropriate tier and add-ons that meet your specific requirements. For detailed information, please refer to the documentation on [Private Data Plane Security Levels](#) and [Private Data Plane Management Models](#).

### Data Encryption

#### What options are available for subscribers to encrypt their data?
Choreo provides robust encryption mechanisms for system components in the data planes, leveraging cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud-native technologies to ensure the security of the subscriber's data. This built-in encryption offers seamless protection for system-level components.

Additionally, application developers have the flexibility to implement their own encryption mechanisms to safeguard their business data. This allows developers to tailor security solutions to meet specific organizational or regulatory requirements, ensuring maximum control over data protection strategies.

#### How is data encrypted in transit?
WSO2 encrypts data in transit by leveraging TLS 1.2. Furthermore, all CDP and PDP communications within the cluster are encrypted using Cilium WireGuard encryption. WireGuard uses the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm with a 256-bit key.

#### How is data encrypted at rest?
WSO2 ensures data at rest is encrypted using cloud service provider (CSP) technologies, including disk and database encryption. These mechanisms typically utilize AES-256 encryption to provide robust security.

#### How are Secrets encrypted?
Secrets are encrypted using cloud service provider-managed keys and securely stored in key management services, such as Key Vaults. These services ensure robust encryption, centralized management, and controlled access to sensitive data.

### Are application service users stored securely?
Choreo ensures that application service users are stored and managed securely by leveraging trusted and industry-standard identity providers.
* **User Authentication**: Choreo primarily authenticates users through well-established social logins, such as Google, GitHub, and Microsoft, ensuring the security of user credentials. Additionally, Choreo supports [Enterprise ID logins](#), allowing seamless integration with your organization's identity provider for Single Sign-On (SSO). This means the complexity of password management is handled by the chosen identity provider, not Choreo itself, minimizing security risks.
* **API Consumer Authentication and Authorization**: Choreo uses [Asgardeo as the default external identity provider](#) (IDP), which can be used to securely manage end-user identities. If you prefer to use an external IDP like [Azure Active Directory](#), Choreo allows flexible integration, ensuring that user management and authentication are securely handled by the respective external IDP.
* **User Tokens**: The Choreo Console stores the tokens in the browser's session storage and uses them to authenticate the user with the backend services. Choreo CLI persists the tokens in an encrypted file in the local machine's file system. The key to decrypt the tokens is stored in the system's Keychain. The Choreo VSCode Extension uses the Choreo CLI to manage the tokens and invoke backend services.

By utilizing these secure, trusted identity providers and protocols, Choreo guarantees that user data is securely managed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Data Isolation
Choreo's Data Plane system components operate independently, relying only on the Choreo Control Plane for control instructions and user workload configuration. Once user workloads receive traffic, the Control Plane connection is no longer required, ensuring that the data plane's core functions remain isolated and unaffected by external dependencies.

Within the Data Plane, workloads are organized into [projects](#) following a [cell-based architecture](#). This structure allows subscribers to control the visibility of their endpoints, deciding whether they are exposed to the public, accessible to other projects, or kept private within the project. This level of control reinforces service isolation by clearly delineating which services interact and how they are exposed.

### System Availability
Uptime SLAs, along with exclusions and Service Credit plans, are detailed in the [Choreo Support Policy](#).
